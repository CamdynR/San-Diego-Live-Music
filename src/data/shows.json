As a teenager, Wilson studied composition privately with John Cage, and since his 1977 self- released classic You Think You Really Know Me, he has spent a lifetime building a fervent underground audience around the world. Esteemed artists Beck,Tyler the Creator, Ariel Pink, Questlove, Earl Sweatshirt,Peanut Butter Wolf, Foxygen, andDam Funk have all cited Gary Wilson as a source of inspiration. He is the subject of the 2005 documentary, You Think You Really Know Me: The Gary Wilson Story, and is mentioned by name in Beck’s 1996 classic “Where It’s At”.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, the Metropolitan Museum of Art included Gary in the exhibition PUNK: Chaos to Couture, and the underground legend has graced the pages of The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Record Collector Magazine. Wilson’s music has been featured in an episode of Narcos (2015) as well as during the Golden Globes (2017), and his track “You Were Too Good to Be True” appears as a sample on Earl Sweatshirt’s track “Grief”” (2015). In recent years, Wilson has shared the bill at live performances with Todd Rundgren, Ariel Pink, Foxygen, Colin Caulfield (Diiv), Crush, and Black Lips.\n\nGary Wilson has performed on national TV on both The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel Live! He continues to diligently compose, record, and release new music, including 2019’s The King of Endicott (Cleopatra Records) and his summer 2019 collaborative album with home recording legend R.

Her sound blends elements of folk, dream pop, and indie rock, and her lyrics reveal an affecting and arresting storyteller. A spirit of independence and experimentation characterize Green’s approach to music, with all of her releases featuring her in the roles of producer and multi-instrumentalist.\n\nGreen's haunting sophomore album, Lore, is a series of vignettes that immerse the listener in dreams and nightmares of the West. It's a world where the natural and supernatural collide, wailing spirits wander lost highways, and shapeshifting starling murmurations soar overhead of restless loners. Green produced and recorded Lore at home on a 16-track reel-to-reel, and the collection of tales are enveloped by a distinctive and otherworldly sound, with weeping steel guitar, washy organ, and ghostly vocal layering reverberating from a distant dimension. Out now, Lore is a rugged, eerie, and wild homage to both a real and imagined place.\n\n––\n\nDuff Thompson is a songwriter, musician, and producer whose music is a swampy blend of folk, pop, and garage rock. As a songwriter, he has a rare ability to distill emotional complexity into simple, sincere songs that instantly hit the listener on a visceral level. As a producer, he draws from influences that span across decades and genres, merging them into a cohesive and organic sound recognizable as his own. \n\nThompson's latest work is a dark, alienated, and swaggering duology of albums titled Shadow People and Shadow People II. Created over two weeks of intensive recording, the Shadow People series comprise 19 total tracks split across two albums. Whereas Thompson’s 2020 debut album, Haywire showcased his versatility and folk influences, Shadow People and Shadow People II are a more cohesive collection of songs that push his music further into the world of garage and indie rock.\n\nPresented by Soda.\n\nThis is a 21+ event",

I’m from Oakland, CA, and grew up in the Bay Area up loving music and played in bands in the indie and punk scenes in the Bay. My band got banned from playing 924 Gilman because we weren’t punk enough. That’s whack lol. Too indie for the punk clubs and too punk for the indie clubs. We loved Red Hot Chili Peppers, Funkadelic, and The Clash.\n\nWe had to learn to record ourselves because no one else wanted to do it. We snuck into Guitar Center and abandoned offices and slept in them to record. We loved to skate, party, prank people, and smoke blunts listening to Mac Dre. Classic Bay shit. We lived in our van and toured around the country living off of peanut butter and water. Super fun rock band energy. We had a lot of fun!\n\nI’ve gotten to produce music with 6LACK, Khalid, Saint JHN, Glass Animals, and lots of awesome musicians.\n\nMy incredibly talented friends and I have toured as Pink Skies (some from the OG band!) and we have gotten to play with incredible artists like Cannons, The Knocks, Neil Frances, Goth Babe, Ritt Momney, Boy Pablo, Del Water Gap, Day Wave, TV Girl, and Tim Atlas.

Their song “Natural One” became a hit single, reaching no. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and no. 4 on the Modern Rock Charts. They released one more album, Dare to be Surprised, on Communion before signing to Interscope Records. The band dissolved shortly after the release of their major label debut, 1999’s One Part Lullaby.\n\nThey surprised fans when they reunited in 2021 and self-released the Feel It If You Feel It EP in 2022. \n\n2024's Walk Thru Me is their first album of new music in 25 years. Separated from their homes in Massachusetts and North Carolina, Barlow and Davis collaborated remotely, flashing back to their early friendship as penpals. A sweaty bass and drums session went down in Barlow’s attic, before they booked studio time with producer Scott Solter (St. Vincent, Spoon, The Mountain Goats).  \n\n“Because we’re so separate, part of this album is me desperately trying to telepathically communicate to John and Scott, who are 700 miles away from me,” Barlow concludes. “A big part of what I consider to be the Folk Implosion is taking disparate things and turning them into pop.”\n\nPresented by Soda.\n\nThis is a 21+ event",

Rubeck and Minor originally formed the band in Reno in 2013 releasing a number of albums and becoming a staple of the local music scene. When Rubeck moved to Los Angeles, the band went on an indefinite hiatus with hopes to someday make music together again. In 2021, Minor moved to Los Angeles and the two members recruited Holter who would add a pop and electronic sensibility to the band’s indie rock sound ushering the band into a new era. Influenced by the likes of My Bloody Valentine, Björk, Broadcast and Cocteau Twins, Casino Hearts debut EP, Lose Your Halo, is a sonic quilt of dream pop, distorted guitars and trance-like beats anchored by Holter’s ethereal gossamer voice. The band will release their second EP, ‘A Walk in The Grass’ in early March.  It’s safe to say Casino Hearts have found their final form.\n\nPresented by Soda.\n\nThis is a 21+ event",

While they have also found success with their side project, Lola's Pocket PC, it is their cult-acclaimed\n\nalbum Come in that has garnered them a large and dedicated following through its raucous musical universe and serpentine sparklepunk stylings. Often heralded as an achievement of lo-fi bedroom pop tangled with threads of emo and DIY, Come in is better described, in its author’s own words, as a “life goal.”\n\nThe initial spark that ignited the fiery, heated debut from Weatherday originated from Sputnik’s desire to write, perform, and produce a record all on their own, from the ground up. Starting in 2014-2015, their preliminary attempts at what would eventually become Come in first materialized as a shoegaze EP, and then a dream-pop meets chamber-pop LP. Ever the perfectionist though, Sputnik wasn’t satisfied with the results and deleted the releases without a trace, finally deciding to set out in the direction of something more akin to their longtime influences of emo and its various subgenres. After two years of tinkering in this stylistic sweetspot, Sputnik settled on the eleven knotted, maximal tracks that comprise Come in. From the caustic, harsh peaks of “Sleep in while you’re doing your best” to the soothing piano-laden passages of “Embarrassing paintings” and experimental, granular coda of “Water dreamer the same,” the range of Weatherday’s debut is doubtlessly a product of an artist who refuses to compromise a single shred of their vision.\n\nPresented by Soda.\n\nThis is a 21+ event",

At a Worn-Tin show, it’s not only about the music - you can expect a performance. from drinking his own urine to getting arrested on stage.\n\nWhen not feverishly writing new music, Worn-Tin can be found skating, gardening or crying in the attic.\n\n**Freak Nature Puppets** – is a collective of artists, performers, and puppeteers from Los Angeles.
