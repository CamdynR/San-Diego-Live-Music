        "description": "This is a 21+ event w/ valid ID at Soda Bar - San Diego.\n\nSteph Green's music is for those who fancy the art of songwriting, depicting a lonely world illuminated by strangeness and beauty. Her sound blends elements of folk, dream pop, and indie rock, and her lyrics reveal an affecting and arresting storyteller. A spirit of independence and experimentation characterize Green‚Äôs approach to music, with all of her releases featuring her in the roles of producer and multi-instrumentalist.\n\nGreen's haunting sophomore album,¬†Lore, is a series of vignettes that immerse the listener in dreams and nightmares of the West. It's a world where the natural and supernatural collide, wailing spirits wander lost highways, and shapeshifting starling murmurations soar overhead of restless loners. Green produced and recorded¬†Lore¬†at home on a 16-track reel-to-reel, and the collection of tales are enveloped by a distinctive and otherworldly sound, with weeping steel guitar, washy organ, and ghostly vocal layering reverberating from a distant dimension. Out now,¬†Lore¬†is a rugged, eerie, and wild homage to both a real and imagined place.\n\n‚Äì‚Äì\n\nDuff Thompson is a songwriter, musician, and producer whose music is a swampy blend of folk, pop, and garage rock. As a songwriter, he has a rare ability to distill emotional complexity into simple, sincere songs that instantly hit the listener on a visceral level. As a producer, he draws from influences that span across decades and genres, merging them into a cohesive and organic sound recognizable as his own.¬†\n\nThompson's latest work is a dark, alienated, and swaggering duology of albums titled¬†Shadow People¬†and¬†Shadow People II.¬†Created over two weeks of intensive recording, the Shadow People series comprise 19 total tracks split across two albums. Whereas Thompson‚Äôs 2020 debut album,¬†Haywire¬†showcased his versatility and folk influences,¬†Shadow People¬†and¬†Shadow People II¬†are a more cohesive collection of songs that push his music further into the world of garage and indie rock.\n\nPresented by Soda.\n\nThis is a 21+ event",

My band got banned from playing 924 Gilman because we weren‚Äôt punk enough. That‚Äôs whack lol. Too indie for the punk clubs and too punk for the indie clubs. We loved Red Hot Chili Peppers, Funkadelic, and The Clash.\n\nWe had to learn to record ourselves because no one else wanted to do it. We snuck into Guitar Center and abandoned offices and slept in them to record. We loved to skate, party, prank people, and smoke blunts listening to Mac Dre. Classic Bay shit. We lived in our van and toured around the country living off of peanut butter and water. Super fun rock band energy. We had a lot of fun!\n\nI‚Äôve gotten to produce music with 6LACK, Khalid, Saint JHN, Glass Animals, and lots of awesome musicians.\n\nMy incredibly talented friends and I have toured as Pink Skies (some from the OG band!) and we have gotten to play with incredible artists like Cannons, The Knocks, Neil Frances, Goth Babe, Ritt Momney, Boy Pablo, Del Water Gap, Day Wave, TV Girl, and Tim Atlas.

While they have also found success with their side project, Lola's Pocket PC, it is their cult-acclaimed\n\nalbum Come in that has garnered them a large and dedicated following through its raucous musical universe and serpentine sparklepunk stylings. Often heralded as an achievement of lo-fi bedroom pop tangled with threads of emo and DIY, Come in is better described, in its author‚Äôs own words, as a ‚Äúlife goal.‚Äù\n\nThe initial spark that ignited the fiery, heated debut from Weatherday originated from Sputnik‚Äôs desire to write, perform, and produce a record all on their own, from the ground up. Starting in 2014-2015, their preliminary attempts at what would eventually become Come in first materialized as a shoegaze EP, and then a dream-pop meets chamber-pop LP. Ever the perfectionist though, Sputnik wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the results and deleted the releases without a trace, finally deciding to set out in the direction of something more akin to their longtime influences of emo and its various subgenres. After two years of tinkering in this stylistic sweetspot, Sputnik settled on the eleven knotted, maximal tracks that comprise Come in. From the caustic, harsh peaks of ‚ÄúSleep in while you‚Äôre doing your best‚Äù to the soothing piano-laden passages of ‚ÄúEmbarrassing paintings‚Äù and experimental, granular coda of ‚ÄúWater dreamer the same,‚Äù the range of Weatherday‚Äôs debut is doubtlessly a product of an artist who refuses to compromise a single shred of their vision.\n\nPresented by Soda.\n\nThis is a 21+ event",

        "description": "This is a 21+ event w/ valid ID at Soda Bar - San Diego.\n\nLos Pira√±as is an international instrumental supergroup that has been pushing the boundaries of Latin tropical music for some time now. This band represents th√© psychedelic sound of contemporary Colombia and has been spearheading the revival of the Colombian music scene.\n\nFor almost 30 year Eblis Alvarez (Meridian Brothers), Mario Galeano (Frente Cumbiero, Ondatropica) and Pedro Ojeda (Romperayo) have been putting their eccentric stamp on Latinamerican styles like vallenato, Peruvian chicha, and Colombian champeta, just to name a few.\n\nLos Pira√±as combine these styles with a rock attitude, noisy improvisations and absurd musical humor. Think of Captain Beefheart in an exotic mood. Completely crazy, but very danceable and enjoyable at the same time.\n\nTheir European tours catapulted them on some great festivals already, like Roskilde where they rocked a crowd of 10.000 people, Druga Godba in Ljubljana and Best Kept Secret in The Netherlands, just to name a few.\n\nTheir latest album, Historia Natural, was released in October 2019 on the Glitterbeat label, just before corona kicked in. In 2022 the band finally was able to do an European tour again and then took some time off to pursue other projects.\n\nGood news though, as Los Pira√±as are back on track and working on a new album, to be released early March 2025, on Glitterbeat again.\n\nPresented by Soda.\n\nThis is a 21+ event",

        "description": "The Squirrel Nut Zippers began their musical journey in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in¬† the mid 1990‚Äôs, as a musician‚Äôs escape from the cookie cutter world of modern rock¬† radio at the time. Jimbo Mathus along with wife Katherine Whalen and drummer Chris¬† Phillips formed the band as a casual musical foray playing for friends and family around¬† town. It wasn‚Äôt long before the band (which had grown in size) developed a reputation for pioneering a quirky mix of jazz chords, folk music, and punk rock leanings and¬† attracted a national audience.¬†\nOutside of the rollicking concerts which were rapidly growing in attendance, NPR was¬† the first significant national media to take notice of the band followed by an appearance¬† on Late Night With Conan O‚ÄôBrien. With grunge, and alternative rock in full swing back¬† in 1995, the Squirrel Nut Zippers debut album The Inevitable sounded like nothing¬† happening musically at the time. After the bands sophomore release Hot became a¬† surprise commercial success, the group went on to sell more than 3 million albums between 1995 and 2003.¬†\nSome highlights of this era include performing on Dick Clarks New years Eve broadcast;¬† playing Carnegie Hall with Tony Bennet; appearing as musical guest on Sesame Street;¬† performing on late night television including Letterman, Leno, Conan; having a custom¬† animated video made by The Simpsons; performing at Bill Clintons Inaugural Presidential Ball; multiple sold out tours, and even getting the keys to the city of¬† Cambridge, MA where the bands namesake candy hails from.¬†\nSince those days the Squirrel Nut Zippers have continued to perform to a wide variety¬† of audiences, venues and settings, and have recently released two new studio albums.¬†\nBeasts Of Burgundy released in 2018 debuted at #4 on the Billboard Jazz Albums Chart to critical acclaim: ‚ÄúThere is, of course, jazz of various stripes (mainly pre-WWII¬† varieties) on this deliciously wide-ranging comeback, but there‚Äôs so much more: sounds,¬† identifiable and not, emanating from mysterious times and places, not the least of which¬† is New Orleans, their home base, a land that, forever and still, has a mind of its own.‚Äù¬† ‚Äì Relix¬†\nLost Songs of Doc Souchon released in 2020 is a combination of newly written Zippers¬† material, along with a few songs from past times like ‚ÄúAnimule Ball‚Äù which was originally¬† recorded in 1938 by Jelly Roll Morton. In keeping with that time period, the band turned¬† ¬†to their longtime friends at Fleischer Studios (home of Betty Boop) to use some of their¬† historic animations for a video for the track. Watch here:¬†¬†\nhttps://youtu.be/ser63u9MmYM¬†\nThe Squirrel Nut Zippers continue to confound audiences with their hybrid stew of¬† Southern roots music, New Orleans Jazz, Vaudeville, Blues and a healthy touch¬† irreverence. Not traditionalists ‚Äì true originals.",

        "description": "For more than three decades, conguero Poncho Sanchez has stirred up a fiery stew of straightahead jazz, gritty soul music, and infectious melodies and rhythms from a variety of Latin American and South American sources. Throughout his career Sanchez has held aloft the torch lit by such innovators as Mongo Santamaria, Tito Puente and Cal Tjader, embraced by each of those icons and entrusted to carry forward the traditions of Latin Jazz.\n¬†\n\nSanchez‚Äôs influences are numerous, and his catalogue is rich with his homages to several of his mentors ‚Äì Santamaria, Puente and Tjader among them. But alongside those Latin pioneers, among the more prominent figures that inform his music is the iconic saxophonist John Coltrane. On his latest album Trane‚Äôs Delight, Sanchez pays tribute to the late jazz legend with Latin-tinged reimaginings of Coltrane classics as well as new pieces composed in honor of the tenor titan.\n¬†\n\nTrane‚Äôs Delight continues Sanchez‚Äôs remarkable 37-year relationship with Concord, a rich legacy that has now yielded 27 albums. The album features the conguero alongside his longtime band; trombonist and musical director Francisco Torres, trumpet and flugelhorn master Ron Blake, saxophonist Robert Hardt, pianist Andy Langham, bassists Rene Camacho and Ross Schodek, and percussionists Joey DeLeon and Giancarlo Anderson.¬†\n¬†\n\nThe album provides a direct link from the 67-year old conguero to his 11-year old self, who spent his own money on an album for the first time when he bought the 1962 classic Coltrane. Ultimately, Trane‚Äôs Delight offers a tribute not only to the stellar music and influence of the great John Coltrane, but a spotlight for the myriad ways that the tenor giant‚Äôs explorations have fueled courageous artists like Poncho Sanchez. The results, as on this passionate new album, would no doubt delight Trane‚Äôs searching spirit.¬†\n¬†\n\nAlthough born in Laredo, Texas, in 1951 to a large Mexican-American family, Sanchez grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles, where he was raised on an unusual cross section of sounds that included straightahead jazz, Latin jazz and American soul. By his teen years, his musical consciousness had been solidified by the likes of John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Cal Tjader, Mongo Santamaria, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. Along the way, he taught himself to play guitar, flute, drums and timbales, but eventually settled on the congas.\n¬†\n\nAt 24, after working his way around the local club scene for several years, he landed a permanent spot in Cal Tjader's band in 1975. \"I learned a great deal from Cal,\" says Sanchez, \"but it wasn't as though he sat me down and taught me lessons like a schoolteacher. Mostly it was just a matter of being around such a great guy. It was the way he conducted himself, the way he talked to people, the way he presented himself onstage. He was very elegant, very dignified, and when he played, he played beautifully. The touch that he had on the vibes ‚Äì nobody has that sound. To me, he was ‚Äì and is, and always will be ‚Äì the world's greatest vibe player.\"\n¬†\n\nSanchez first formed his own group in 1980, leading his ensemble during Tjader's vacation periods and recording two albums for Discovery. The conguero remained with Tjader until the bandleader's death in 1982. That same year, he signed with Concord for the release of Sonando, an album that marked the beginning of a musical partnership that has spanned nearly four decades and yielded more than two dozen recordings. Trane‚Äôs Delight is the latest installment in that ongoing partnership.\n¬†\n\nAfter more than two decades in music, Sanchez's efforts paid off when his album Latin Soul received a Grammy award as Best Latin Album of 1999. Throughout the next decade, Sanchez continued to record, releasing such albums as 2000's Soul of the Conga, 2001's Latin Spirits, 2003's Out of Sight!, 2005's Do It!, 2007's Raise Your Hand, and 2009's hard bop-influenced Psychedelic Blues. In 2011, he paid tribute to the innovative Afro-Cuban recordings of Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo by teaming up with trumpeter Terence Blanchard for Chano y Dizzy! Sanchez followed that up with a vibrant concert set with his Latin Jazz Band entitled Live in Hollywood.\n¬†\n\nWith Trane‚Äôs Delight, Poncho Sanchez continues to honor the giants whose music has helped shape his own, while building upon the rich legacy they‚Äôve left behind. As this celebratory and heartfelt album exemplifies, he‚Äôs long since joined the ranks of the luminaries to whom he pays such profound tribute. Sanchez‚Äôs deeply personal reimagining of the jazz canon, as well as his own spirited original compositions, affirm his place at the forefront of Latin Jazz‚Äôs trailblazers.",

        "description": "Colin Patrick Harper hails from the tiny island of Bermuda. In the music industry, he is known as the reggae artist Collie Buddz. Buddz was born on August 21, 1984 in New Orleans, Louisiana. After graduating from high school, he attended Full Sail University in Winter Park, FL, where he decided to study studio engineering. Upon graduating from the top in his class at Full Sail in 2006, Buddz began looking for work in the recording industry as a performer or producer. One of his first major gigs was working with recording star Shaggy on the single \"Mad Mad World\" from Shaggy's new album at the time entitled Intoxication, which was released in 2007. That was the same year Collie released his self-titled debut album with Sony Music with tracks such as ‚ÄòCome Around‚Äô and ‚ÄòBlind To You‚Äô.¬† The album was a success and well-received by critics. WWE (World Wrestling Enterprises) fans would immediately recognize Buddz's voice from the entrance theme (\"SOS\") for WWE superstar wrestler Kofi Kingston, which was included on the 2008 compilation WWE The Music, Vol. 8. Over the next year, he would continue making guest appearances on the works of many other artists.\n\nIt is no small coincidence that his stage name \"Buddz\" is slang for marijuana. There have been photographs taken of the artist holding bongs and other pot-smoking paraphernalia over the years. Of course, other reggae artists such as Bob Marley have made weed seem an essential part of the reggae lifestyle. When not working in the studio, Collie found himself selling out venue after venue on one of his many exhaustive tours.¬† Now with new music being released and a good reputation under his belt, Buddz finds himself playing at some of the biggest reggae music festivals all across the world such as, Reggae Rise Up, One Love New Zealand, and California Roots Music Festival\n\nAt the end of the decade, Buddz started his own record label called Harper Digital.¬† In 2011, he would finally release his second album entitled Playback followed shortly with the Blue Dreamz EP.¬† Buddz would then go on to release his next album ‚ÄòGood Life‚Äô fully independently through Harper Digital with features from the likes of Snoop Dogg, Jody Highroller, and the Bay Area‚Äôs very own, P-Lo.\n\nMore recently, he has finished up his fully self produced album ‚ÄòHybrid‚Äô which came out in the spring of 2019.¬† Hybrid is Collie Buddz's third full-length album. The album is fully produced by Buddz and features two tracks with Russ, as well as tracks with Tech N9ne, B Young, Stonebwoy, Dizzy Wright, and Johnny Cosmic. The first five songs on the album have been released and highly praised as singles. The FADER called \"Love & Reggae\" a \"quintessential reggae jam,\" and Billboard praised \"Bank\" feat. Russ & B Young, claiming \"Buddz effortlessly [flowed] on the self-produced melody.\" Meanwhile, \"Bounce It\" featuring Ghanian Grammy nominee Stonebwoy has gotten radio play around the world including on Sirius XM Pitbull's Globalization channel, and Buddz's latest single \"Show Love\" has quickly earned radio play on Sirius XM The Joint and was added to Spotify's elite New Music Friday playlist.",

        "description": "In the middle of July 2023 in a Los Angeles studio, Deep Sea Diver mastermind Jessica Dobson ¬†took a guitar solo but somehow felt nothing. Just days earlier, her Seattle band played a series of ¬†semi-secret shows for devotees at a hometown bar, de facto rehearsals for cutting a new record. ¬†The sets had gone well, but, almost immediately, the sessions didn‚Äôt. The songs‚Äô essence seemed ¬†\nmuddled, Dobson‚Äôs conviction lost somewhere in the 1,000 miles between Southern California ¬†and the home studio she shares with partner, drummer, and frequent cowriter Peter Mansen. On ¬†that first night in Los Angeles, she broke down, wondering what she was doing there, what her ¬†band could do to fix it. For the first time ever, Deep Sea Diver retreated, heading home without ¬†an album. Did they need to scrap it all, to begin again with new material? ¬†\nNot at all: Following a brief break, Dobson found a renewed sense of self, a trust in her vision ¬†for her band and songs and her ability to capture them. After that Los Angeles hiccup, longtime ¬†collaborator Andy Park asked Dobson how the new stuff was going over an early fall dinner. She ¬†admitted she needed help. In that humbling confession, she soon found ways of working that ¬†helped her reimagine and reinvigorate Deep Sea Diver and led directly to the power and ¬†brilliance of Billboard Heart, Deep Sea Diver‚Äôs fourth album and first for Sub Pop. It is a coup, a ¬†triumph over self-doubt in which what first felt like failure became an opportunity to find new ¬†freedom, belief, and strength. You can hear it in each of these 11 songs, the beating heart that ¬†makes everything here feel like a new anthem for finding your own way forward. ¬†\nThe cocksure Bad Seeds swagger of ‚ÄúShovel,‚Äù the tender mercies of ‚ÄúLoose Change,‚Äù the ¬†serpentine machinations of ‚ÄúLet Me Go,‚Äù where Dobson tangles with fellow guitar dynamo ¬†Madison Cunningham: Billboard Heart immediately puts Deep Sea Diver in the company of St. ¬†Vincent, TV on the Radio, and Flock of Dimes, bands that have found newly ornate and ¬†magnetic ways to make indie rock by discarding notions of how it must sound or what it must ¬†say. Dobson punches through her past here. As she howls during Billboard Heart‚Äôs rapturous title ¬†track, she is ‚Äúwelcoming the future by letting go of it.‚Äù ¬†\nExactly three years before Dobson‚Äôs galvanizing dinner with Park, Deep Sea Diver issued its ¬†third album, 2020‚Äôs Impossible Weight, via ATO, the colossal indie imprint that has helped My ¬†Morning Jacket, Alabama Shakes, and King Gizzard build careers across the last quarter-century. ¬†It was a significant step up for a band that had self-released its first two LPs. The surge of ¬†resources resulted in a groundswell of exposure, even a spot on Billboard charts. ¬†\nThat success, though, caused Dobson to doubt her impulses, to begin thinking about what an ¬†idea‚Äôs impact or reception might be as much the strength of the idea itself. During this period of ¬†second-guessing, she and Mansen sat near the wide windows of their Seattle living room, with ¬†her on piano as he hammered a guitar nearby. ‚ÄúSee in the Dark‚Äù‚Äîa song about coveting your¬†\nown notions, despite the occasional sense they‚Äôre slipping away‚Äîemerged in that single sitting, ¬†its gothic elegance and pop grandeur proffering a blueprint for what else could come.¬†\nThat moment of domestic creation proved essential for several reasons. Before Impossible ¬†Weight, Dobson and Mansen wrote many of Deep Sea Diver‚Äôs songs together; this was a return ¬†to that bond, which carried over to more than half of Billboard Heart. What‚Äôs more, the pair ¬†began recording more at home, too. They borrowed microphones and a small clutch of essential ¬†gear to capture guitars and vocals in their basement. When talks later began in earnest with Park ¬†following the Los Angeles debacle, Dobson began revisiting those earlier recordings, realizing ¬†that she had captured so much of that ineffable spark at home, where the atmosphere was of her ¬†own design. Mansen and Park helped convince her these weren‚Äôt just good enough to use but ¬†riveting in their realness. These early versions became templates and blueprints to build upon and ¬†frame, plus a way for Dobson to believe again in the material and, most important, herself.¬†\nAnd from end to end, the material on Billboard Heart is astonishing. The title track is the one ¬†song Deep Sea Diver actually finished in Los Angeles. It‚Äôs a radiant and magnificent thing, the ¬†billowing synths of member Elliot Jackson and tunneling pedal steel of guest Greg Leisz pushing ¬†up an anthem for fearlessly advancing into the future, as best you can. ‚ÄúEmergency‚Äù links ¬†hardcore‚Äôs famous vim to electroclash‚Äôs instant allure, Dobson‚Äôs italicized voice racing like a ¬†gust of wind. Her brief guitar solo at the end is an all-timer, a few hiccupping notes suddenly ¬†moving like a sports car in terrifyingly tight corners. Tender and vulnerable, ‚ÄúTiny Threads‚Äù is a ¬†sweeping anthem for anyone trying to hold anything together‚Äîlife, love, themselves. ‚ÄúIf it ¬†haunts me, let it haunt me,‚Äù Dobson sings softly over a stillness framed only by bass and noise. ¬†She lets her guitar careen into feedback, then steadily sculpts it into something tuneful. It‚Äôs a ¬†lifetime of anxiety and sublimation, crystallized into 10 seconds. Billboard Heart feels that way ¬†at large.¬†\nFor a minute there, Dobson let that mix of art and commerce we call the music industry cloud ¬†her judgment and interfere with her impulses, a common enough story for anyone whose decades ¬†of work suddenly yield success. She found her way out of that wormhole by embracing newness, ¬†whether that meant practicing songwriting as if it were collegiate homework, believing in her ¬†skills recording at home, or playing bass herself because the band had blown so much money ¬†during those aborted Los Angeles sessions. (N.B. The big but elastic bass lines are a consistent ¬†highlight here, so: good choice.) ¬†\nMostly, she let go of the fear that comes when we think about our jobs, no matter what they are, ¬†and remembered that making music is less work than a way of reckoning and playing with the ¬†world, of healing and finding other ways forward. Billboard Heart emerged when Dobson ¬†trusted her instincts, a personal breakthrough that prompted an artistic one. It is, in turn, the best ¬†Deep Sea Diver album yet, a defiant and brilliant exclamation mark at the end of a long period of ¬†wandering.",

He was born in Manchester, England, where he studied voice ¬†and acting at St. Bede‚Äôs College and the Manchester School of Music and Drama. As a ¬†child, he played ‚ÄúStanley Fairclough‚Äù in the long-running British soap opera Coronation ¬†Street. He was also featured in the television series Knight Errant, Family Solicitor and ¬†Monro‚Äôs Saki Stories. ¬†\nAt the age of fifteen, Peter achieved international fame as ‚ÄúHerman‚Äù, lead singer of the ¬†legendary pop band Herman‚Äôs Hermits. His classic hits include: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Into Something ¬†Good‚Äù, ‚ÄúMrs. Brown, you‚Äôve Got A Lovely Daughter‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Henry VIII, I Am‚Äù, ¬†‚ÄúSilhouettes‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt You Hear My Heartbeat‚Äù, ‚ÄúWonderful World‚Äù, ‚ÄúJust A Little Bit ¬†Better‚Äù, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs A Kind of Hush‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Must To Avoid‚Äù, ‚ÄúListen People‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo Milk ¬†Today‚Äù ‚ÄúThe End of the World‚Äù ‚ÄúLeaning On A Lamp Post‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù. Ultimately, ¬†Herman‚Äôs Hermits sold over fifty-two million recordings. In all, fourteen singles and ¬†seven albums went gold. ¬†\nAs ‚ÄúHerman‚Äù, the photogenic Noone graced the cover of nearly every international ¬†publication including Time Magazine. He performed on hundreds of television shows and ¬†appeared with such luminaries as Ed Sullivan, Jackie Gleason, Dean Martin and Danny ¬†Kaye. He was cast as the engaging ‚ÄúDuke of Cheshire‚Äù in ABC‚Äôs musical version of The ¬†Canterville Ghost. Soon thereafter, he portrayed the title role in Hallmark Hall of Fame‚Äôs ¬†Pinocchio. He also starred in three highly successful feature films for M-G-M: Mrs. ¬†Brown, You‚Äôve Got A Lovely Daughter, Hold On! and When The Boys Meet The ¬†Girls.¬†\nWith characteristic zeal, Peter took on leading roles in full-scale theatrical productions of ¬†Dick Wittington, Aladdin and Sinbad The Sailor. These live stage spectaculars were ¬†mounted at major theatres throughout Great Britain and Noone received critical acclaim for ¬†his outstanding work. In the eighties, Peter starred on Broadway in the New York ¬†Shakespeare Festival‚Äôs production of Gilbert and Sullivan‚Äôs The Pirates of Penzance. He ¬†won rave reviews for his superb portrayal of the dashing, young hero, ‚ÄúFrederic‚Äù. His ¬†performance was so well received, that he went on to reprise the role at the world-famous ¬†Drury Lane Theatre in London. Noone charmed audiences worldwide as he continued to ¬†play ‚ÄúFrederic‚Äù with both the U.S. National Touring Company and the International ¬†Touring Company of ‚ÄúPirates‚Äù.¬†\nPeter‚Äôs acting career flourished with guest-starring roles in prime-time television series ¬†such as: Married With Children, My Two Dads, Dave‚Äôs World, Easy Street, Too ¬†Close For Comfort, and Laverne and Shirley. In a memorable episode of Quantum ¬†Leap, he shed his ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù image to portray ‚ÄúDwayne‚Äù, a scheming promoter with ¬†murderous intentions. He starred as ‚ÄúApoo‚Äù, a frustrated African relief worker, in the Los ¬†Angeles stage premiere of Topokana Martyr‚Äôs Day and as Alfred Von Wilmers in the ¬†U.S. National Tour of the smash Broadway hit Romance, Romance.",

        "description": "‚ÄúLife changes fast,‚Äù Joan Didion once wrote. ‚ÄúLife changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.‚Äù\n\nIn the spring of 2020, Blonde Redhead singer and multi-instrumentalist Kazu Makino encountered this passage from Didion‚Äôs 2005 memoir of grief, The Year of Magical Thinking, in which the author reflected on the devastating experience of witnessing her husband‚Äôs sudden death at the dinner table. Amid the profound uncertainty of those early pandemic months, Makino was thinking of her own parents far away in Japan; the then-lost ritual of congregating for dinner with family; and the heavy, omnipresent feeling that life could change in the instant for any of us.\n\nWith plainspoken language and incandescent melodies, Makino narrated these feelings on a pair of songs, ‚ÄúSit Down for Dinner Pt I‚Äù and ‚ÄúSit Down for Dinner Pt II,‚Äù which helped title the tenth full-length from Blonde Redhead. ‚ÄúSit Down to Dinner Pt II‚Äù thematically transcends time: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sort of about death, but the music is so alive and groovy,‚Äù Makino says. Yet, the title Sit Down for Dinner has a separate resonance for the Italian members of Blonde Redhead, the Milan-born twin brothers Amedeo Pace (singer / multi-instrumentalist) and Simone Pace (drummer). ‚ÄúCulturally, dinner is important to us,‚Äù Simone says of the nonnegotiable family ritual. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a moment for us to sit down and have time with each other. We grew up that way. I know a lot of people eat and run, eat in front of their TV, or don‚Äôt care about it too much‚Äîand that‚Äôs OK‚Äîbut we really do.‚Äù Dinner has long been a sacred ritual for Blonde Redhead as a band as well; when they‚Äôre on tour or rehearsing, they always share a meal, no matter what.\n\nOwing to that sense of persistent togetherness, the immersive, meticulously-crafted Sit Down for Dinner is a testament to the unique internal logic Blonde Redhead have refined over their three-decade existence. Formed in the 1993 New York indie underground, Blonde Redhead quickly found a place on Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley‚Äôs label, Smells Like, before releasing beloved records on Touch & Go and 4AD that traced an arc from angular indie-rock to cosmopolitan art pop. The trio might have been a quintessential ‚Äô90s band, if not for the fact that they continuously kept going, growing, never confined to any era but the present.\n\nOn Sit Down for Dinner, the understated yet visceral melodies charging each song create a foil to lyrics about the inescapable struggles of adulthood: communication breakdown in enduring relationships, wondering which way to turn, holding onto your dreams. Going into the record, Makino had recently spent time living on a tiny Italian island and pursuing solo music‚Äîan experience that instilled in her new confidence to experiment and have fun. She returned to New York as the world was locking down, quarantining with Amedeo and his partner upstate, where they focused on the music in seclusion. Immaculately structured, imbued with sensitivity, clarity, and resolve, Sit Down for Dinner was ultimately written and recorded over a five-year period spanning New York City, upstate, Milan and Tuscany.\n\nThe luminous groove and chord progression of ‚ÄúSnowman,‚Äù sung by Amedeo, is one of many Blonde Redhead songs inspired by the attitude and breeziness of Brazilian experimental music; a brilliant turn of phrase melts its titular snowman into simply a man, struggling to express himself: ‚ÄúDo you feel alive or do you only fall? So like a no man, that you are.‚Äù Makino wrote ‚ÄúRest of Her Life‚Äù as an elegy for her cherished late horse, Harry, who she considered ‚Äúalmost like my soulmate‚Äù (and whose loss in 2020 moved her to read The Year of Magical Thinking). The song‚Äôs vocal layers were inspired by the Swingle Singers‚Äô a capella renditions of Bach.\n\nThe subtly brooding ‚ÄúIf‚Äù embodies the existential unease of middle age, struggling to orient oneself and locate where, and who, are home. The widescreen introspection of ‚ÄúI Thought You Should Know‚Äù confronts the experience of being misunderstood, or unheard, by those closest to you. On ‚ÄúKiss Her Kiss Her,‚Äù when Makino sings, ‚ÄúEven stars are closer,‚Äù the lyric references a short story in Khul-Khaal, by the Arabic writer Nayra Atiya, in which a woman hopes to divorce her husband, and is told ‚Äúeven the stars are closer‚Äù than such a possibility. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about someone with a bold, entirely far-fetched dream, where you know it will end in tears, but you want to be supportive anyway.‚Äù\n\nElsewhere, the songs of Sit Down for Dinner find ways forward in pure experimentation. ‚ÄúMelody Experiment‚Äù received its title when Makino ‚Äúunlocked the song with the melody‚Äù in a moment of serendipity. ‚ÄúI was singing a little bit off, in a bluesy way, and I was so fascinated,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt feels quite new, like something I haven‚Äôt done before.‚Äù With its stacked backing vocals, ‚ÄúBefore‚Äù was written with children‚Äôs voices in mind, narrated from the perspective of a kid who thinks they know it all. ‚ÄúChildren have incredible abilities,‚Äù Makino says. ‚ÄúThey have a confidence that is so whole, they can see through you a little.‚Äù Amid the windswept melodies and arrestingly bittersweet tone of ‚ÄúNot for Me,‚Äù Amedeo gave himself the challenge of vulnerability, writing while Makino was in Italy, longing for that kind of freedom. ‚ÄúYou ran with the flowers/And further than water/And further than our walls,‚Äù he sings. ‚ÄúMove to the side, move to the light, move to a place that no one can find.‚Äù\n\nReleasing Sit Down for Dinner in its 30th year, Blonde Redhead‚Äôs perseverance partially came in realizing that the process of making the record should necessarily be fun. ‚ÄúUsually I agonize and it‚Äôs painful for me to write music, but on this one, I didn‚Äôt suffer as much,‚Äù says Makino. ‚ÄúI wanted to put my foot down and say: we can have a nice time together. The record sounds quite optimistic.‚Äù Amedeo adds, ‚ÄúWe do really respond to each other. We depend on each other for inspiration. Kazu completes what I start; Simone completes both with rhythm.‚Äù\n\nPerhaps this gives the title Sit Down for Dinner yet another layer, as the music, fittingly, is a pleasure, with the ease of new conversation among familiar friends. Crucial to that equation are Blonde Redhead‚Äôs innate harmonic sensibilities, which Makino calls the core of the band. ‚ÄúWe have a language we have kept,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúWe try to change rhythms, concepts, and sounds. But that harmonic sensibility has stayed the same. It hits the same part of your heart.‚Äù",

        "description": "‚Äú‚ÄôJust play what you feel, be real about it, and enjoy yourself.‚Äô That‚Äôs what Albert Collins taught me,‚Äù says the award-winning guitar virtuoso and soul-deep singer Coco Montoya. The self-taught, left-handed Montoya mastered his craft under Collins‚Äô tutelage. Incorporating lessons learned from his mentors, the iconic Collins (for whom he originally drummed), and UK legend John Mayall, Montoya puts his own stamp onto every song he performs. Since his first solo album in 1995 (which won him the Blues Music Award for Best New Artist), Montoya‚Äôs endlessly inventive guitar work and passionate, hard-hitting vocals have kept him at the top of the blues world. With his new Alligator Records album, Writing On The Wall (his sixth for the label), Montoya delivers what he is already calling one of the best records he‚Äôs ever made. For the very first time on Alligator, he decided to bring his road-tested band‚Äînoted keyboardist and songwriter Jeff Paris (Keb‚Äô Mo‚Äô, Bill Withers), bassist Nathan Brown, and drummer Rena Beavers‚Äîinto the studio with him. Between the camaraderie of the long-time bandmates and the sheer talent of all involved, the results have left Coco, in his words, ‚Äúover the moon.‚Äù¬†\n¬†\nProduced by Grammy Award-winner Tony Braunagel (Bonnie Raitt, Taj Mahal) and co-produced by Jeff Paris, Writing On The Wall is a tour-de-force of memorable, hook-filled songs, sung with passion and fueled by equally memorable, top shelf musicianship. The 13 tracks include five written or co-written by Montoya. The set opens with a signature, career-defining performance of the soul-baring I Was Wrong, written for Coco by songwriter Dave Steen. From the blistering Save It For The Next Fool to the enjoy now/pay later philosophy of Jeff Paris‚Äô (I‚Äôd Rather Feel) Bad About Doin‚Äô It to the riveting reinvention of Lonnie Mack‚Äôs Stop, Montoya delivers each song with heart-pounding emotion. Special guest Lee Roy Parnell adds his well-seasoned slide guitar to the smoldering A Chip And A Chair. And Coco‚Äôs friend, guitarist Ronnie Baker Brooks (son of late Alligator star Lonnie Brooks), joins in for some good-natured fun on the droll Baby, You‚Äôre A Drag and adds his blistering playing to the searing cover of Bobby Bland‚Äôs You Got Me.¬†\n¬†\n‚ÄúI am so proud of this one,‚Äù Montoya says of Writing On The Wall. ‚ÄúWe recorded in Jeff Paris‚Äô studio and everything just gelled together. And the band inspired me; they all gave extra effort at every turn. Jeff, Nathan and Rena played so great, they ended up making me play even harder. They made me sound better than I am!‚Äù¬†\n¬†\nHenry ‚ÄúCoco‚Äù Montoya was born in Santa Monica, California, on October 2, 1951, and raised in a working-class family. Growing up, Coco immersed himself in his parents‚Äô record collection. He listened to big band jazz, salsa, doo-wop and rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll. His first love was drums; he acquired a kit at age 11. He got a guitar two years later. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the Beatles had something to do with this,‚Äù Montoya recalls. ‚ÄúI wanted to make notes as well as beats.‚Äù But guitar was his secondary instrument. Montoya turned his love of drumming into his profession, playing in a number of area rock bands while still in his teens and becoming an in-demand drummer.¬†\n¬†\nIn 1969, Montoya saw Albert King opening a Creedence Clearwater Revival/Iron Butterfly concert at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. He was transformed. ‚ÄúAfter King got done playing,‚Äù says Montoya, ‚Äúmy life was changed. When he played, the music went right into my soul. It grabbed me so emotionally that I had tears welling up in my eyes. Nothing had ever affected me to this level. He showed me what music and playing the blues were all about.\nI knew that was what I wanted to do.‚Äù¬†\n¬†\nThe next chapter of Montoya‚Äôs story was kick-started by a chance meeting in the mid-1970s with legendary bluesman Albert Collins. Montoya says, ‚ÄúAlbert was coming through Los Angeles and needed to borrow my drum set, which I left at the club where he was going to be playing. I went down to see his show that night and it just tore my head off. The thing that I had seen and felt with Albert King came pouring back on me when I saw Albert Collins.‚Äù¬†\n¬†\nA short time later, Collins hired Montoya as his band‚Äôs drummer. With Albert mentoring Coco on the guitar during the band‚Äôs downtime, Coco soon became Collins‚Äô second guitarist. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd sit in hotel rooms for hours and play guitar,‚Äù remembers Montoya. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd play that beautiful rhythm of his and just have me play along. He was always saying, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt think about it, just feel it.‚Äô He was like a father to me,‚Äù says Coco, who often slept at Collins‚Äô home. When Collins declared Montoya his ‚Äúson,‚Äù it was the highest praise and affection he could offer. In return, Montoya learned everything he could from the legendary Master of the Telecaster.¬†\n¬†\nNeeding a more regular paycheck, Montoya left Collins‚Äô band after two years and took a job tending bar, jamming on weekends at Los Angeles clubs. One day, legendary British musician John Mayall heard Coco playing Otis Rush‚Äôs All Your Love (I Miss Loving) onstage. Soon after, Mayall called on Montoya to join his famous Bluesbreakers. Filling the shoes of previous Bluesbreaker guitarists Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor would not be easy, but Montoya knew he could not pass up the opportunity to play with another legend. For the next ten years he toured the world and recorded with Mayall on seven albums, soaking up the experience of life on the road and in the recording studio.¬†\n¬†\nMontoya‚Äôs recorded debut as a bandleader came with 1995‚Äôs Gotta Mind To Travel (originally on Silvertone Records in England and later issued in the USA on Blind Pig Records). The album became an instant fan favorite. Blues enthusiasts, radio programmers and critics sent praise from all corners. The album immediately made it clear that Montoya ranked among the best players on the contemporary scene. Two more Blind Pig albums followed, and Coco was well on his way.¬†\n¬†\nIn 2000, Montoya‚Äôs Alligator debut, Suspicion, quickly became the best-selling album of his career, earning regular radio airplay on over 120 stations nationwide. Montoya‚Äôs fan base exploded. After two more highly successful and massively popular Alligator releases‚Äî2002‚Äôs Can‚Äôt Look Back and 2007‚Äôs Dirty Deal‚ÄîMontoya signed with Ruf Records, cutting both a live and a studio album. Returning to Alligator with 2017‚Äôs Hard Truth and 2019‚Äôs Coming In Hot, the guitar master continued to blaze his trail. ‚ÄúMontoya unleashes one career-topping performance after another,‚Äù declared the UK‚Äôs Blues Matters.¬†\n¬†\nStill an indefatigable road warrior, Montoya continues to tour virtually nonstop, bringing audiences to their feet from New York to New Orleans to Chicago to San Francisco. Across the globe, he‚Äôs performed in countries including Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, England, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Ecuador, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Czech Republic and Canada.¬†\n¬†\nNow, with the dynamic Writing On The Wall and a tour calendar busting at the seams, Coco Montoya is as excited as he‚Äôs ever been to perform the new songs live with his burning-hot band. Montoya‚Äôs well-earned reputation as an eye-popping live performer precedes him. Vintage Guitar states, ‚ÄúCoco keeps getting better and better. He plays with fire and passion rarely seen in this day and age.‚Äù Billboard declares, ‚ÄúIn a world of blues guitar pretenders, Coco Montoya is the real McCoy. He exudes power and authenticity. Be prepared to get scorched by the real thing.‚Äù",

Two years after the trio's groundbreaking debut, the group split and Carlos moved on to pursue a solo career.After spending three years developing his songwriting craft and grooming his distinctive vocal style, Carlos released his debut solo record Suffering in May 1981. The strong release took the industry by storm and soon became a massive hit in Africa.

But when a band decides to follow up their last album from over 26 years ago? That‚Äôs high on testicular fortitude and as dumb as fidget spinners. Yet, when that band is the Jesus Lizard, everything in your pathetic cultural dystopia suddenly falls away and the air smells like Heaven‚Ä¶ Their seventh studio album, Rack, produced by Paul Allen, and slated for release on September 13 via Ipecac Recordings, features 11 tracks of brisk guitar rock you haven‚Äôt heard since‚Ä¶ the last time the Jesus Lizard took over a stage in your town. The Jesus Lizard ‚Äî vocalist David Yow, guitarist Duane Denison, bassist David Wm. Sims, and drummer Mac McNeilly ‚Äî have returned with a record teeming with the kind of madness needed to beat down today‚Äôs AOR mediocrity and piss-perfect pop drivel alike.\n¬†\n\nSince their inception in Chicago in 1987, the Jesus Lizard has thrilled audiences all over the planet. The impeccable rocket-thrust rhythm section of Sims and McNeilly was the perfect launchpad for Denison‚Äôs jagged yet clean-toned riffing and Yow‚Äôs mercurial vocalizations manifesting as everything from panicked citizen, reality escapee or wounded sea mammal. The Jesus Lizard‚Äôs fury carried on through six studio albums, two live recordings and a brace of singles and EPs.\n¬†\n\nOn Rack, the Jesus Lizard have returned reconstituted, refreshed and positively revving. No tepid, bland tracks to show how they‚Äôve ‚Äúmatured‚Äù as songwriters. No inane detours into unnecessary genre exercises. And definitely no weird moves into experimental realms that come off just as contrived and calculated as the top of the Billboard Charts. The opening salvo ‚ÄúHide & Seek‚Äù finds Yow singing/sprechstimming his way with remarkable clarity as his bandmates shore him up with their patented acceleration. The noir vibes coming off of ‚ÄúWhat If?‚Äù is a startling direction for the band, with Yow narrating the action, like he was looking at a random person in an airport lounge and concocting an elaborate backstory about them. The sinister ‚ÄúAlexis Feels Sick‚Äù is inspired by Girls Against Boys/Soulside drummer Alexis Fleisig‚Äôs guarded opinion of modern life that turns into a treatise of man‚Äôs inhumanity to man. ‚ÄúMoto(R)‚Äù is playing out of the coolest car tailgating in the parking lot at one of those horrific radio-rock fests. And while we‚Äôre on the subject of forcing cool into uncool,¬†‚ÄúFalling Down‚Äù reminds all of us in slightly under three-and-a-half minutes how marvelously badassed the Jesus Lizard have always been, making our fists ball-up so tightly they look like the ends of chicken bones.\n\nThe Jesus Lizard.

They use any beat that catches their ear,regardless of geography or genre, to create a compelling, horn driven polyrhythmic groove.They continue exploring the multifaceted grooves of Latin America and the Caribbean, incorporating the sounds of\n\nCuba, Jamaica, Mexico and Brazil with the funk, rock, jazz and hip-hop rhythms of their homeland, dropping bits of Cumbia, Salsa, gritty street Samba, Son Montuno, Jarocho and Boogaloo into the mix.\n\nThe B*Side Players have been laying down their own inimitable latin global funk since they came together in 1994.Their incendiary live shows have defined them as local favorites with 10 San Diego Music awards. Meanwhile their albums showcase a band with restless musical intelligence, effortlessly blending genres to fashion their own forward\nlooking, latin flavored soul music. As an eight piece band the players are known for igniting crowds with their fierce rhythms and uplifting message of unity and consciousness. Meanwhile always keeping their focus on the political climate of the world and nation.

        "description": "Yo La Tengo - This Stupid World\n\nTime keeps moving and things keep changing, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can't fight back. Yo La Tengo have raced time for nearly four decades and, to my ears, they just keep winning. The trio‚Äôs latest victory is called This Stupid World, a spellbinding set of reflective songs that resist the ever-ticking clock. This is music that‚Äôs not so much timeless as time-defiant. ‚ÄúI want to fall out of time,‚Äù Ira Kaplan sings in ‚ÄúFallout.‚Äù ‚ÄúReach back, unwind.‚Äù\n\nPart of how Kaplan, Georgia Hubley, and James McNew escape time is by watching it pass, even accepting it when they must. ‚ÄúI see clearly how it ends / I see the moon rise as the sun descends,‚Äù they sing during opener ‚ÄúSinatra Drive Breakdown.‚Äù In the s√©ance-like \"Until it Happens,‚Äù Kaplan plainly intones, ‚ÄúPrepare to die / Prepare yourself while there‚Äôs still time.‚Äù But This Stupid World is also filled with calls to reject time ‚Äì bide it, ignore it, waste it. \"Stay alive,\" he adds later in the same song. \"Look away from the hands of time.‚Äù\n\nOf course, times have changed for Yo La Tengo as much as they have for everyone else. In the past, the band has often worked with outside producers and mixers. Yo La Tengo made This Stupid World all by themselves, though. And their time-tested judgment is both sturdy enough to keep things to the band‚Äôs high standards, and nimble enough to make things new.¬†\n\nAnother new thing about This Stupid World: it‚Äôs the most live-sounding Yo La Tengo album in a while. At the base of nearly every track is the trio playing all at once, giving everything a right-now feel. Take the signature combination of hypnotic rhythm and spontaneous guitar on ‚ÄúSinatra Drive Breakdown,‚Äù or the steady chug of ‚ÄúTonight‚Äôs Episode,‚Äù a blinkered tunnel of forward-moving sound. There‚Äôs an immediacy to the music, as if the distance between the first pass and the final product has been made a touch more direct.¬†\n\nThe songs on This Stupid World were still journeys, though. An example is the absorbing, three-dimensional ‚ÄúBrain Capers.‚Äù To construct this swirl, the band blends guitar chords, bass loops, drum punches, and various iterations of Hubley and Kaplan's voices into shifting layers. Simpler but just as dense is closer ‚ÄúMiles Away.\" A dubby rhythm lurks below Hubley‚Äôs vocal, which brushes across the song like paint leaving bright blurs. Throughout the album, these touches, accents, and surprises intensify each piece. It‚Äôs a rarity ‚Äì a raw-sounding record that gives you plenty of headphone-worthy detail to chew on.\n\nThis Stupid World gives your brain a lot to digest, too. All the battles with time drive toward some heavy conclusions. In the gripping ‚ÄúAselestine,‚Äù Hubley sings about what sounds like a friend on death's door: ‚ÄúThe clock won‚Äôt tick / I can‚Äôt predict / I can‚Äôt sell your books, though you asked me to.‚Äù In ‚ÄúApology Letter,‚Äù time turns simple communication into something fraught and confusing: \"The words / Derail on the way from me to you.‚Äù Not everything is so serious, though. The absurdist ‚ÄúTonight‚Äôs Episode\" helps McNew learn to milk cows, steal faces, and treat guacamole as a verb. And somehow Alice Cooper, Ray Davies, and Rick Moranis show up in ‚ÄúBrain Capers,‚Äù all telling us time isn‚Äôt finished yet.\n\nSo I guess everyone on This Stupid World grapples with how time keeps steamrolling and how we keep trying to do something about it. It‚Äôs there in the title, a weary but clear-eyed pejorative that suggests determined resignation, a will to fight despite the grim odds. It‚Äôs there in the title track too: ‚ÄúThis stupid world ‚Äì it‚Äôs killing me / This stupid world ‚Äì is all we have.‚Äù Such realism leads to the resolute optimism of This Stupid World‚Äôs parting shot, ‚ÄúMiles Away,‚Äù which sees time‚Äôs passage and life's impermanence as things to deal with rather than reasons to despair. ‚ÄúYou feel alone / Friends are all gone,\" Hubley prays softly. \"Keep wiping the dust from your eyes.‚Äù\n\nMarc Masters",

        "description": "On his new album In Plain Sight, Neal Francis offers up a body of work both strangely enchanted and painfully self-aware, unfolding in songs sparked from Greek myths and frenzied dreams and late-night drives in the depths of summer delirium. True to its charmed complexity, the singer/songwriter/pianist‚Äôs second full-length came to life over the course of a tumultuous year spent living in a possibly haunted church in Chicago. The result: a portrait of profound upheaval and weary resilience, presented in a kaleidoscopic sound that‚Äôs endlessly absorbing.\n¬†\nThe follow-up to Francis‚Äôs 2019 debut Changes‚Äîa New Orleans-R&B-leaning effort that landed on best-of-the-year lists from the likes of KCRW, KEXP, and The Current, and saw him hailed as ‚Äúthe reincarnation of Allen Toussaint‚Äù by BBC Radio 6‚ÄîIn Plain Sight was written and recorded almost entirely at the church, a now-defunct congregation called St. Peter‚Äôs UCC. Despite not identifying as religious, Francis took a music-ministry job at the church in 2017 at the suggestion of a friend. After breaking up with his longtime girlfriend while on tour in fall 2019, he returned to his hometown and found himself with no place to stay, then headed to St. Peter‚Äôs and asked to move into the parsonage. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd only stay a few months but it turned into over a year, and I knew I had to do something to take advantage of this miraculous gift of a situation,‚Äù he says.\n¬†\nMixed by Grammy Award-winner Dave Fridmann (HAIM, Spoon, The Flaming Lips, Tame Impala), In Plain Sight finds Francis again joining forces with Changes producer and analog obsessive Sergio Rios (a guitarist/engineer known for his work with CeeLo Green and Alicia Keys). Like its predecessor, the album spotlights Francis‚Äôs refined yet free-spirited performance on piano, an instrument he took up at the age of four. ‚ÄúFrom a very early age, I was playing late into the night in a very stream-of-consciousness kind of way,‚Äù he says, naming everything from ragtime to gospel soul to The Who among his formative influences. With a prodigy-like gift for piano, Francis sat in with a dozen different blues acts in Chicago clubs as a teenager, and helmed a widely beloved instrumental funk band called The Heard before going solo. Along with earning lavish acclaim (including a glowing review from Bob Lefsetz, who declared: ‚ÄúTHIS IS THE FUTURE OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS!‚Äù), Changes led to such triumphs as performing live on KCRW‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorning Becomes Eclectic,‚Äù sharing the stage with members of The Meters at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and touring with such acts as Lee Fields & The Expressions and Black Pumas.\n¬†\nRecorded entirely on tape with his bandmates Kellen Boersma (guitar), Mike Starr (bass), and Collin O‚ÄôBrien (drums), In Plain Sight bears a lush and dreamlike quality, thanks in large part to Francis‚Äôs restless experimentation with a stash of analog synths lent by his friends in his early days at the church. ‚ÄúMy sleep schedule flipped and I‚Äôd stay up all night working on songs in this very feverish way,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just needed so badly to get completely lost in something.‚Äù In a move partly inspired by Led Zeppelin‚Äôs Houses of the Holy, In Plain Sight takes its title from a track Francis ended up scrapping from the album. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a song about my breakup and the circumstances that led to me living in the church, where I‚Äôm owning up to all my problems within my relationships and my sobriety,‚Äù says Francis, whose first full-length chronicles his struggles with addiction. ‚ÄúIt felt like the right title for this record, since so much of it is about coming to the understanding that I continue to suffer because of those problems. It‚Äôs about acknowledging that and putting it out in the open in order to mitigate the suffering and try to work on it, instead of trying to hide everything.‚Äù\n¬†\nThe opulent opening track to In Plain Sight, ‚ÄúAlameda Apartments‚Äù makes for a majestic introduction to the album‚Äôs unveiling of Francis‚Äôs inner demons. ‚ÄúI started writing that song maybe six years ago, before I got sober,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI was going through another breakup and getting kicked out of my place, and I had a nightmare about moving into an art-deco apartment that was haunted, where the walls were all shifting around.‚Äù A prime showcase for Francis‚Äôs piano work, ‚ÄúAlameda Apartments‚Äù simulates that dream state in its untethered melodies, luminous grooves, and lyrics that drift from despair to detached curiosity (e.g., ‚ÄúIt remains to be seen if the ghosts are all right‚Äù). ‚ÄúThe craziest thing is that I‚Äôd never encountered the name ‚ÄòAlameda‚Äô in any time in my life prior to that dream,‚Äù says Francis. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bizarre that I even remembered it, especially since you don‚Äôt dream very often when you‚Äôre getting fucked up.‚Äù¬†\n¬†\nOn ‚ÄúProblems,‚Äù In Plain Sight eases into a brighter and breezier mood, with Francis mining inspiration from early-‚Äô70s Sly & the Family Stone and the glistening soft rock of Mirage-era Fleetwood Mac. But in a stark contrast to the track‚Äôs radiant synth and rapturous harmonies, ‚ÄúProblems‚Äù centers on Francis‚Äôs exacting introspection. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being half-in and half-out of a relationship, and how untenable that is,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI wrote it at a time when I really couldn‚Äôt maintain a relationship, because I had too many issues with myself that needed to be addressed.‚Äù¬†\n¬†\nGraced with a smoldering slide-guitar solo from the legendary Derek Trucks, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Stop the Rain‚Äù arrives as the first unabashedly hopeful moment on In Plain Sight. ‚ÄúI wrote that with my buddy David Shaw, who came up with the refrain and this idea that even though life‚Äôs going to throw all this shit at you, there‚Äôs still so many things to be grateful for,‚Äù says Francis. Propelled by the track‚Äôs cascading piano lines and wildly soaring vocals, that refrain takes on an unlikely anthemic power as Francis shares a bit of gently expressed encouragement: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop the rain/It‚Äôs always coming down/It‚Äôs always gonna fall/But you‚Äôre not gonna drown.‚Äù\n¬†\nOn the guitar-heavy and glorious ‚ÄúPrometheus,‚Äù Francis nods to the Greek myth of the Titan god who stole fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to the humans. As punishment, Prometheus spent eternity chained to a rock as an eagle visited each day to peck out his liver‚Äîwhich then grew back overnight, only to be eaten again the following day in a neverending cycle of torment. ‚ÄúThat song came from the lowest ebb of quarantine, when Chicago was literally on fire,‚Äù Francis says. ‚ÄúIt came to me while I was driving around all these abandoned streets in the middle of the night, and turned into a song about facing my problems with addiction and feeling like I‚Äôm chained to this set of compulsions.‚Äù Threaded with plainspoken confession (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not in my nature to try to do better‚Äù), the track features a sprawling synth arrangement informed by the many hours Francis spent playing the St. Peter‚Äôs pipe organ. ‚ÄúI call that section of the song ‚ÄòThe Pope,‚Äô‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs this grand, powerful entry that‚Äôs sort of sinister, and then it just drops away.‚Äù\n¬†\nBy the end of his surreal and sometimes eerie experience of living at the church‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm convinced that the stairway leading to the choir loft where I used to practice is haunted,‚Äù he notes‚ÄîFrancis had found his musicality undeniably elevated. ‚ÄúBecause I was forced into this almost monastic existence and was alone so much of the time, I could play as often and as long as I wanted,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI ended up becoming such a better pianist, a better writer, a better reader of music.‚Äù Dedicated to a woman named Lil (the de facto leader of the St. Peter‚Äôs congregation), In Plain Sight ultimately reveals the possibility of redemption and transformation even as your world falls apart.\n¬†\n‚ÄúWhen I started the process of writing these songs, I was so emotionally out-of-sorts and really kind of hopeless that I‚Äôd be able to come up with anything,‚Äù says Francis. ‚ÄúBut then I sat down and started working, and embraced whatever inspiration came my way. Sometimes it felt like beating my head against a wall, but I tried to trust that it would lead somewhere. The whole thing was like a weird dream‚Äîthis very strange time of terrible, wonderful isolation.‚Äù",

        "description": "America comes together in the music of Martin Sexton. Our hearts mend, our political and philosophical differences melt away, and the various strains of our roots music entangle. Of Sexton, The New York Times says: ‚ÄúHis unpretentious heartiness helps him focus on every soul singer‚Äôs goal: to amplify the sound of the ordinary heart.\"¬†\nSexton has remained true to his mission of sharing peace and harmony throughout his 10 albums, and in countless incendiary live performances. He has thus built a loyal following of fans, including critics and superstar artists. He is without a doubt what Billboard calls: ‚ÄúThe real thing.‚Äù¬†\nThese days, people are coming together to revel in Sexton‚Äôs musicality for his Martin Sexton Abbey Road Show. This is a live show extravaganza in which he performs the iconic Beatles‚Äô album in its entirety followed by a set of mainly original music. Currently, Sexton is also working on his 11th album, which will be his first full-length album in 10 years.¬†\nSexton is a songwriter‚Äôs songwriter, with a multi-octave voice that knows no bounds. Acoustic Guitar Magazine calls him a: \"Master of dynamics, reducing a room to silence with his blustering baritone, then teasing that silence with a fluttering falsetto.\" ¬†\nSexton‚Äôs career in music has unfolded like the stories in one of his sweetly redemptive songs. He got his start busking on streets and performing at open mics. Since then, he has gone on to be praised by modern legends such as John Mayer and Dave Matthews, who calls him one of his favorite singer songwriters. Sexton‚Äôs songs of grappling and gratitude were the soundtrack to John Mayer‚Äôs early gigging years, and made an indelible impact on the budding songwriter. Mayer says: ‚ÄúThis is the music of my LIFE.‚Äù¬†\nSexton has headlined venues from The Fillmore to Carnegie Hall, and his songs have appeared in television series such as Scrubs, Parenthood, Masters of Sex, and in numerous films. His dynamically emotive live show has earned him critical raves and an engaged and loyal following. The Wall Street Journal says: ‚ÄúMr. Sexton as an impassioned performer can bring women and men to tears when they see him live.‚Äù",

The band gained widespread attention with their debut album Treats (2010), a high-energy mix of distortion and pop hooks, highlighted by the breakout track \"Rill Rill.\"\nFollowing Treats, their sophomore album Reign of Terror (2012) refined their sound, incorporating darker, more personal themes while retaining their raw intensity. With Bitter Rivals (2013), they embraced a more aggressive, pop-driven approach, and their 2016 album Jessica Rabbit saw them exploring experimental textures and atmospheric production. Texis (2021) marked another shift, blending elements of early electro, new wave, and hip-hop influences.\nThroughout their career, Sleigh Bells has become known for their high-energy live shows and genre-defying sound, pushing boundaries in indie and alternative music. Their fearless approach to production and songwriting has earned them a dedicated fanbase and a lasting influence on a new generation of experimental artists.",

        "description": "Devendra Banhart (b. 1980, Houston, Texas) lives and works in Los Angeles. An internationally renowned musician considered a pioneer of the ‚Äúfreak folk‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew Weird America‚Äù movements, Banhart has toured, performed, and collaborated with Vashti Bunyan, Yoko Ono, Os Mutantes, the Swans, ANOHNI, Caetano Veloso, and Beck, amongst many others. His musical work has always existed symbiotically alongside his pursuits in the other fine arts.\n\nBanhart emerged seemingly out of nowhere in 2002 with his first CD collection, Oh Me Oh My‚Ä¶The Way the Day Goes By the Sun Is Setting Dogs Are Dreaming Lovesongs of the Christmas Spirit, compiled by Swans frontman Michael Gira for his Young God label from homemade recordings the itinerant Banhart had amassed as he traveled the world. He was born Devendra Obi Banhart in Houston, Texas, but spent his childhood in Caracas, Venezuela; as a teenager, his family returned to the States, relocating in Southern California, where he soon became enamored of skateboard culture.¬†\n\nMusic was always a passion for Banhart, and he discovered it in ways both magical and haphazard. As a boy in Caracas, says Banhart, ‚ÄúI was surrounded by salsa, merengue, cumbia, some bossa nova‚Äîthat was ubiquitous, you‚Äôd hear it on any street.‚Äù In high school, Banhart became obsessed with rocksteady, bluebeat, and ska, which he‚Äôd learned about via skateboarding videos. Finishing high school, he thought he would pursue a visual arts career so he enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute, but he soon dropped out in favor of exploring music. He has, however, successfully maintained a parallel career as a visual artist: Banhart‚Äôs distinctive, minutely inked, often enigmatic drawings have appeared in galleries all over the world, including the Art Basel Contemporary Art Fair in Miami; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels; and Los Angeles‚Äô Museum of Contemporary Art and Nicodim Gallery.\n\nSan Francisco had an indelible influence on Banhart; the flamboyant dressing he adopted that entranced the fashion crowd (and fueled the ‚Äúfreak folk‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew Weird America‚Äù labels the press attached to him) was inspired in part by the seriously subversive cross-dressing culture of San Francisco‚Äôs legendary performance troupe the Cockettes.\n\nLike former label-mates Caetano Veloso and David Byrne, Banhart has embraced an astonishingly wide range of musical ideas, from folk to blues to the avant garde. He extols the late Arthur Russell, a relentlessly eclectic artist who was impossible to pigeonhole in his brief lifetime, and Banhart has brought back into the spotlight forgotten artists like late-‚Äô60s singer Vashti Bunyan, whose psychedelic folk he championed. He has collaborated with Brazilian legends Os Mutantes, the Swans, ANOHNI, and Beck, among others, and has engaged in art projects like conceptualist Doug Aitken‚Äôs monumental 2012 Song 1 video installation on the fa√ßade of the Hirschhorn Museum in Washington, DC.\n\nFor Banhart, his career remains ‚Äúan adventure and an exploration.‚Äù Banhart admits, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really take care of my voice, but, just like with playing guitar, you get more familiar with it, and you get better at it. I‚Äôve always said that I‚Äôm very good at not knowing how to play the guitar but, really, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm very comfortable with the utter uncertainty of my approach.‚Äù",

        "description": "The Wooten brothers‚Äô first public performance occurred in Hawaii in 1966 and established their identity as prodigies. Regi, the eldest son of Elijah \"Pete\" and Dorothy, was born in 1956. The first three sons arrived just a year apart‚ÄîRoy in ‚Äô57, Rudy in ‚Äô58. Joseph was born in ‚Äô61, and three years later, in '64, Victor came. Victor learned to talk and play music at the same time.¬†\n\nFast forward six years.¬†\nREGI, still the leader of the family band, is 13 years old and Victor, the youngest, is 5, when the Wooten Brothers began opening a series of shows for R & B legends, ‚ÄúWar‚Äù, and two years later for Curtis Mayfield, and many other national acts.\nFast forward to the present, 2024.¬†\nThe Wootens have racked up 10 Grammy wins, and ¬†26, yes, 26 Grammy nominations. And the youngest of the family, Victor, the brother who learned from all his older brothers, has been named by Rolling Stone Magazine as one of the ten greatest bass players of all time.\n\nAcclaim has come to each Wooten brother. ¬†\nREGI is a virtuoso guitarist, also renowned for his musical teaching skills. At the tender age of ten, Regi began teaching bass to his two year old brother Victor, while also teaching keyboard skills to his five year old brother, Joseph. Now, Regi teaches many students who travel from all over the world in various genres of music to learn from him. Regi is affectionately called \"The Teacha\", and he, similar to the legendary teacher Nadia Boulanger, is a teacher to a global family.\n¬†\nROY also known as ‚ÄúFuture Man‚Äù ¬†has invented an instrument called the Drumitar that ¬†is re-discovering the drumset, while helping to re-invent bluegrass and deconstruct jazz.\nAnother instrument Roy invented, the RoyEl, is a piano shaped instrument and an homage to early pre-thirteenth century African-based music and mathematics, that derives rhythms and pitches from the golden ratio.¬†\nWith the insights gained from these new Instruments, Roy also serves as the creator and composer of the Evolution d‚Äô Amour ballet and the Black Mozart Symphony, which introduces the legendary 18th century Black classical artist, Joseph Boulogne de Saint Georges, to the 20th and 21st century.\n\nThe late RUDY WOOTEN, who passed away in 2010, was inspired by the virtuosity and unique articulation of the legendary trumpet master Clifford Brown. He also mastered the playing styles of saxophone legends, Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderly, John Coltrane, and the blind triple saxophone playing master, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, so that his own double saxophone horn parts and solo‚Äôs became legendary!\n\nJOSEPH came to Nashville as a singer but quickly became known as \"The Hands of Soul\" for his keyboard playing skills and songwriting genius. Joseph introduced his playing and songwriting mastery to a wider audience by re-arranging the Steve Miller classic \"Fly like An Eagle\" to include new spoken word lyrics. Since 1993, Joseph has travelled the world with Rock-in-Roll Hall of Famer Steve Miller in his Steve Miller Band, which has now sold over 60 million records‚Äîwith a bulk of the sales ¬†coming after Joseph ¬†became a member of the band.¬†\nAnd the extraordinary music making doesn‚Äôt just happen when the Wooten Brothers play all together or venture out singly-\n\nVictor and Roy, working together with Banjo master Bela Fleck, pianist and harmonica virtuoso Howard Levy, and saxophonist Jeff Coffin ‚Äîwell they earned a whole lot of those Wooten Grammy‚Äôs and Grammy nominations.\n\nThe Brothers' music bends and defines genres; amplifies centuries, and spans continents.¬†\nThe Wooten Brothers began in R+B. They evolved as teens into Jazz, Jazz Fusion, Classical and Country. Then, they emerged in 1985 on Arista records with an album called, \"The Wootens\", that combined Electronic, Funk, Soul, Disco, and Boogie‚Äîand offered only a sliver of the Wooten whole.¬†\nThe Wooten whole is all of that‚Ä¶ and classical, and jazz, and country, and Rock-and-Roll. The Wooten whole is Prince before Prince. Maybe Clive Davis and the Arista team, who were focused on launching the extraordinary Whitney Houston, were not ready for that in 1985.¬†\n\nSo many albums after that Arista album, as the Wootens go their separate ways, they play in giant arenas and in intimate clubs, crisscrossing the globe. They always come back to play together, sometimes close to home, sometimes a thousand miles away from their Middle-Tennessee homes.¬†\n\nSome of the best of times are in a camp Victor has established in a place called ‚ÄúWooten Woods‚Äù, where people from around the world come to be inspired by Nature to learn to play with profound sound and silence to grow in new understanding and tones that are sweet and wise.\nSome of the other best times are in the jazz club named for the one brother who has passed on, Rudy. ¬†¬†\n¬†\nRudy‚Äôs Jazz Room is a live jazz club in Nashville with a growing jazz scene.The Wootens also play jazz and everything else in it, entertaining and inspiring ¬†a growing Nashville music scene and city. The Wooten Brothers have even been known to play heavy metal in their unique Wootinish‚Äîway.\n\nWhat is ‚ÄúThe Wootinish-way‚Äù? It‚Äôs honing your craft, taking the diamond and cutting it just right, and polishing it bright. It‚Äôs not just the in-born genius. It‚Äôs not just the wisdom and insight that comes from inspired and gentle living close to nature, close to art, close to each other. It is a disciplined commitment to the craft of making sound in community and sharing sound with community‚Äîborn of knowing sound and the precious space of silence, ‚Äî a true, good, and saving thing.\n\nAnd so they create new instruments, they revive compositions of dead composers, they leave the families they love, to bring the world they love the sounds they love. And they keep creating, performing, and recording ¬†new music.\n\nAs a family band, they are second to none. But they are comparable to other notable family bands: The Beach Boys, the Allman Brothers, The Neville Brothers, and the Jackson Five. ¬†Sonically inventive, soulful, musically driven, blood kin, that fill the dance floor, tickle the brain, and rock your world-- they are comparable to the best of the best family bands.¬†\nThe Wooten Brothers are the family band you need to know that you don‚Äôt know, or the family band you know, and want the world to know. Connecting ¬†musically deep past to musical future, the Wooten Brothers explode genres and build bridges across genres. ¬†Bar by bar, in live performances and on recordings, they provide an exhilarating ‚Äòconnects-you-to-the-center-of-the-universe‚Äô sound.\n\nThe final Wooten paradox? They make universal music, but they are not universally known. Time to change that. ¬†They are recording new music!! They have discovered deep vault tracks that include their late brother Rudy!",

Songs from throughout the Depeche canon are lovingly recreated; from favorites on DM‚Äôs debut Speak and Spell to the newest fare from ‚ÄòMode‚Äôs latest- 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpirit‚Äù. No detail of STRANGELOVE‚Äôs presentation has been overlooked. The visual presentation with stage set pieces and in-show costume changes reflect different eras of Depeche Mode‚Äôs story.\n\nTruly evocative of a Depeche Mode arena/stadium stage show; the scale of STRANGELOVE‚Äôs theatrical stage production is unparalleled, save for the real article. Custom-produced multimedia projection visuals delight the concertgoer‚Äôs senses and enhance the illusion that they‚Äôre witnessing an actual Depeche Mode concert.\n\nThese accomplished musicians have a reverence and devotion to Depeche Mode‚Äôs body of work that‚Äôs driven them to recreate every possible detail and bring the ‚ÄúMusic To The Masses‚Äù in a concert setting that transcends a mere tribute production; and feels more like a shared communal fan-club celebration of halcyon days of new wave/emerging electronica. Accuracy and authenticity is a hallmark of the project, with the band employing as many authentic vintage synthesizers and samplers as possible in recreating the classic and widely varied sounds of Depeche Mode‚Äôs discography.\n\n‚ÄãWith over 120 million records sold and a rabid international fan base, Depeche Mode‚Äôs status as elder statesmen of electronica was recently cemented with their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame last year. Their enormous fan base encompasses all ages and crosses every demographic. Their last stadium/arena tour in 2018 set world box office records. STRANGELOVE ‚ÄìThe Depeche Mode Experience brings a thoroughly enjoyable and staggeringly authentic DM concert to concertgoers, and connects with international audiences, wherever the group performs.",

        "description": "The second album from Sabrina Teitelbaum, aka Blondshell, borrows its title from a 1986 poem by the cherished American writer Mary Oliver, titled ‚ÄúDogfish.‚Äù In the poem, Oliver grapples with the idea of telling one‚Äôs own story: how much to share, how much to keep for oneself ‚Äî all questions Teitelbaum asked herself while writing If You Asked For A Picture. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a part of the poem that says: I don‚Äôt need to tell you everything I‚Äôve been through. It‚Äôs just another story of somebody trying to survive,‚Äù Teitelbaum says. ‚ÄúSomething I love about songs is that you‚Äôre showing a snapshot of a person or a relationship, and showing a glimpse into a story can be just as important as trying to capture the entire thing. Sometimes it‚Äôs even truer to the entire picture than if you tried to write everything down.‚Äù\n\nBlondshell‚Äôs self-titled 2023 debut unleashed a swiss-army-knife writing style that gets under your skin: songs that are as visceral and anthemic as pop music with all the specificity, self-examination, and nonchalant humor of the best indie rock ‚Äî songs you want to let crash over you, even as their strength is too concrete to be washed away. It‚Äôs a formula that turned Blondshell into one of the most lauded new artists in recent memory. If You Asked For A Picture expands these artistic horizons further, resulting in a collection of songs from an artist now at the peak of her powers that brim with an urgency, ambition, and devastating potency only hinted at until now.\n\nIf You Asked For A Picture is alive with a more vital nuance both sonically and thematically, gesturing towards a deeper autobiographical story that taps into something painfully universal without being too overt. Teitelbaum explains, ‚ÄúThe first record feels really black-and-white to me. This record has more questions.‚Äù The lucid songs of If You Asked For A Picture dig into familial relationships ‚Äî parents who pass on their trauma (as in ‚Äú23‚Äôs A Baby‚Äù), the endless two-way critique between mothers and daughters (the alt-rock daydream ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Fair‚Äù), and the loyalty of a sister who won‚Äôt forget how a man wronged you (the crushingly catchy accidental-love story ‚ÄúT&A‚Äù). Teitelbaum acknowledges her inherent imperfections while trying to extend compassion for the flaws in others. ‚ÄúThe last record was a lot of, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre the villain in this situation, you‚Äôve wronged me, and I‚Äôm really pissed‚Äô‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOn this record it was more like: ‚ÄòHow did I get here? Maybe I‚Äôm the villain too.‚Äô There was something freeing in that.‚Äù A major theme of If You Asked For A Picture is control ‚Äî and the possibility of loosening her grip on it ‚Äî including two songs (‚ÄúThumbtack,‚Äù ‚ÄúToy‚Äù) that touch on Teitelbaum‚Äôs lifelong struggle with OCD.\n\nIn the studio, Teitelbaum found herself confident and at home like never before, trusting her instincts as she developed an almost telekinetic shorthand with producer Yves Rothman. The result is a record of astounding sonic range - including sky-scraping ballads and colossal hooks that soar over waves of distortion, mixing layered textures and harmonic flourishes, or making unexpected hairpin turns between them. Primary among her production touchstones were unexpected curveballs like Queens of the Stone Age‚Äôs Rated R and Red Hot Chili Peppers‚Äô Californication. Teitelbaum reveled in appropriating those hyper-masculine aesthetics for her uncompromising examinations of young womanhood, playing with performances of gender in rock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs empowering for me to use sonic references that feel reserved for men,‚Äù she explains.\n\nIf You Asked for a Picture‚Äôs acoustic opener ‚ÄúThumbtack‚Äù is a bittersweet gut-punch of self-reckoning amid an uneasy relationship. ‚ÄúSo much of the last record was about finding myself in relationships I didn‚Äôt want to be in and not knowing why,‚Äù Teitelbaum says. ‚Äú‚ÄòThumbtack‚Äô is one of those songs, but this record is more about finding out why and trying to be in different types of relationships.‚Äù Who among us¬†\ncan‚Äôt relate to longing for someone even as they prove to be ‚Äúa thumbtack in my side,‚Äù as Teitelbaum sings on the song‚Äôs slyly gigantic hook? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even a good friend,‚Äù she sings, a classic Blondshell mic-drop.¬†\n\nBone-deep revelations like these have become a Blondshell hallmark ‚Äî startling clarity, comforting wit ‚Äî and If You Asked For A Picture is full of them. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be your mom, but you‚Äôre not strong enough,‚Äù she sings before the tidal chorus of ‚ÄúArms.‚Äù On the clear-eyed ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Fair,‚Äù she examines a complex maternal relationship (‚ÄúI grew up fast without you‚Äù), trying to empathize even as she refuses to sweep the truth under the rug. ‚ÄúYou always had a reason to comment on my body,‚Äù she sings, like a century of mother-daughter exchanges compressed to 10 words. Teitelbaum addresses body image throughout the record, whether observing her own changing shape or admitting ‚Äúpart of me still sits at home in a panic over fifteen pounds‚Äù on ‚ÄúEvent of a Fire,‚Äù a road narrative that builds to a blaze of brutal candor, capturing a kind of cinematic back-seat interiority.¬†\n\nIn the time since Blondshell, the image of Teitelbaum‚Äôs life has changed considerably. As the accolades accrued ‚Äî late-night TV performances, countless year-end accolades, landing on Obama‚Äôs Best Songs of 2023 list, covering Talking Heads for A24‚Äôs Stop Making Sense tribute ‚Äî Teitelbaum spent two years on the road. She played 150+ shows in support of her debut, including major festivals and a tour with Liz Phair on top of her own sold-out headline dates. This rootlessness naturally impacted Teitelbaum‚Äôs relationships with others and with herself. ‚ÄúWhen you travel a lot, you see different possibilities for who you can be,‚Äù Teitelbaum says. ‚ÄúSo there were a lot more questions coming up.

        "description": "Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay area, Dave Brock left Northern California in the 1980s to attend school at Long Beach State University.\n\nWhile in college, Dave landed the lead role in The Jim Morrison Rock Opera as the poetically tragic lead singer of The Doors. The late singer's sister, Anna Morrison Graham, and her husband Allan produced the production. Before the production's debut, Brock was featured in many major publications including: Rolling Stone Magazine, The Los Angeles Times Calendar and Bam Magazine. There was quite a buzz in the industry about this production and Dave proved to be quite a good vocalist and performer when the production was ready for the public.\n\nAfter the conclusion of Rock Opera, Dave formed his own live musical stage show performing the music of The Doors called \"Wild Child.\" The live concert show landed at the world famous Whisky a-go-go on the sunset strip on July 3rd, 1986. It was a triple sellout on its very first night. Reviews poured in calling this new show a \"must see\".\n\nThe LA Times said, \"Wild Child is a winner! What's amazing is that vocalist Dave Brock sings like Morrison, enough to imperil the snowflake analogy about no two sets of vocal chords to be able to produce the exact same vocal tone.\" The Daily Bulletin said \"Brock, who bears more than a passing resemblance, evokes the Morrison persona without being forced.\" Jim Ladd, the famous Los Angeles KLOS FM radio DJ and Rock and roll critic described Wild Child to his listeners. \"These Guys are excellent, not a cartoon version of The Doors but a very loving and respectful, accurate and well done tribute to The Doors.\"\n\nSince Wild Child debuted, the act has been touring and playing at sold out national act venues and festivals around the world. Wild Child became the mold that \"tribute bands\" aspired to become, as they flooded the market in the 1990's with good and bad impersonations of famous artists.\n\nIn 1992, Brock was also noticed by film Director and Producer Robert Zemeckis and played the part of Jim Morrison in the comedy film \"Death Becomes Her.\"\n\nIn 2010 Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of The Doors, invited Dave to tour with them as their vocalist on their concert engagements. This was perhaps the best compliment Dave has ever received from anyone for his work. He presently tours with them.\n\nIn recent years, Dave has picked up the game of golf and has become a low handicapper. Dave's interest in the game has also led him into avenues of Charity and Pro-Am Golf events. Dave participated in The Bill Clinton Humana Challenge Pro-Am PGA Tour in 2013 at PGA West, The Patrick Warburton Celebrity Golf Tournament for St Jude Kids and The Scott Medlock - Robby Krieger St. Jude Invitational.\n\nDave currently resides with his family in Southern California, tours with Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of The Doors and with Wild Child.",

        "description": "David Cook (and yes, the same David Cook who launched into stardom following his American Idol Season Seven win ‚Äì breaking several Billboard chart records when 14 of his songs debuted on the Hot Digital Songs chart and 11 of his songs debuted on the Hot 100) certainly knows his way around a good song. His first album, Analog Heart, came out pre-Idol, and his last album, Digital Vein, nicely book-ended that chapter of Cook's career, a chapter during which he sold more than 2 million albums (including his platinum-certified eponymous album) and, collectively, more than 5 million tracks (including two platinum-certified singles) worldwide.¬†\n\nDavid continues to find success, not only for himself, but also as a writer for other artists and touring throughout the world. 2018 brought an exciting new EP from Cook ‚Äì Chromance. \"I was a 'rock' guy, but the further away I've gotten from that, the more I've opened up and found inspiration in the peripherals. I wouldn't have had the courage earlier in my career, but now I have the confidence to go after the sound I want.\" A fan of both Massive Attack and Nine Inch Nails, Cook always admired how they pushed the envelope and brought pop elements into rock music. \"I used them as a bedrock for Chromance and how I wanted the record to feel.\"¬†\n\nIf putting out his 2018 EP wasn't enough to keep Cook busy, that same year he headed to the Great White Way for his Broadway debut as Charlie Price in KINKY BOOTS. \"I've had conversations about finding creative outlets outside of being a musician, but the timing was never right.\" While Cook was excited about his first starring role, he was also aware the message behind KINKY BOOTS was timely and relevant. \"I was honored to be part of the show and get to work with so many amazing people. I love the collaborative aspect of theatre too, the idea of being part of a creative team and working it out in front of an audience each night.\"¬†\n\nAnother passion of Cook's is his work in behalf of organizations such as the National Brain Tumor Society, a Washington DC-based nonprofit that drives cutting-edge research and treatments for brain cancer and brain tumors. \"I've been very involved with this cause and am very grateful that my career has allowed me to do that. I lost my brother Adam to a brain tumor in 2009; every year I am part of the Race for Hope-DC and, together with my fans, have raised over $1.5 million for brain cancer and brain tumor research through this and other fundraising projects. Far and away, that is the proudest of all my achievements.\"¬†\n\nCook is well aware, and grateful, for the breaks American Idol has brought his way, and for the opportunities he continues to have. He has no plans to slow it down. \"I love creative endeavors. I like starting with nothing and then finishing with something that didn't exist before. That's my favorite thing about creating new music. I love being able to put something artistic out in the world for people to enjoy.\"¬†\n\nIn 2020, David released two new singles. The first, Reds Turn Blue, is a nod to the manic highs (reds) and lows (blues) of anxiety, something David has struggled to overcome since his season seven win on\n\nAmerican Idol. As David told People.com: \"This song became a therapeutic process for me, as a way to personify my anxiety and make it something other than me ‚Äî which, in an odd way, has helped me navigate my relationship with it.\" To capture that struggle, David worked with artist Justin A. Nixon to create a visual that was, \"sci-fi and sinister\" but left open-ended to represent \"that constant battle between anxiety and myself.\" And the second, Strange World, is \"my homage to this year,\" said David. \"Staring out of windows at the world outside, feeling disconnected from it, and trying to find those moments that would normally exist outside, inside. \"Both singles, along with the driving Fire are from his EP The Looking Glass, released in April 2021.¬†\n\nIn April 2022, David released his latest single, \"TABOS\" (This'll All Be Over Soon). The single's release coincided with his return to the American Idol¬Æ stage to perform for their special 20th-anniversary reunion show.¬†\n\nIn July 2024, David released his latest single, \"Dead Weight\" co-written with long-time collaborator, Andy Skib to coincide with his summer tour.",

        "description": "Desperado has become one of the best and¬†most well known Eagles tributes in the United States. They boast a line-up of five lead singers and multi-instrumentalists; which not only possess and rivals the musical talents of the actual Eagles, but have been used to play with members of the Hall of Fame band itself.¬† Desperado was founded in 2002 by lead singing guitarist and keyboardist Aaron Broering. For the past 15 years and counting, Aaron and Desperado have displayed pin-point accuracy and care in delivering a completely live show demonstrating their mastery of the timeless musical and lyrical arrangements of the Eagles.\n\nDesperado tirelessly dedicates itself to the diligence of not only the music and vocals but the beautiful preservation of the imagery, mystique, and landscapes of vivid sentiment found in Eagles songs.¬† So much to the point that founder Aaron Broering's original material has been flatteringly¬† compared to artists such as The Eagles and Jackson Browne.\n\nDesperado‚Äôs powerhouse line-up currently consists of founding member Aaron Broering, who played with Eagles guitarist Don Felder, and Eagles co-writer J.D. Souther.¬† Drummer and percussionist Kevin O‚ÄôConnell, Bassist Chris Farmer who was former musical director of the Beach Boys, and Current Bassist for Eagle Timothy B. Schmit , Guitarist Ricky Lewis who‚Äôs played with The Chanteys since 1980 and was performing on television at the Age of 10, and vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Kerry Chester, who has played with artists such as Dick Dale.\n\nDesperado performs annually in large casino show rooms, performing art centers, private and corporate settings, music clubs as well as fairs and outdoor concert festivals. Desperado is a ‚ÄúMust Hear‚Äù for any Eagles fan and concert promoter.

        "description": "Don McLean was born on October 2, 1945, in New Rochelle, New York, to Elizabeth and Donald McLean. By the age of five he had developed an interest in all forms of music and would spend hours listening to the radio and records that were around the house. Childhood asthma meant that Don missed long periods of school and while he slipped back in his studies, his love of music was allowed to flourish. He would often perform shows for family and friends.\n\nAs a teenager, he purchased his first guitar (a Harmony F Hole with a sunburst finish) from the House of Music in New Rochelle and took voice lessons paid for by his sister. These lessons combined with running, walking, and swimming, helped Don to develop breath control, which would later allow him to sing long, continuous phrases, in songs such as ‚ÄúCrying‚Äù, without taking a breath. The exercise also meant his asthma improved.\n\nIn 1961, Don took his only vacation with his father ‚Äì a trip to Washington D.C. Sadly, a few months later his father died. Don was just 15 years old.By this time, Don's musical focus was on folk music thanks, in part, to The Weavers landmark 1955 recording \"Live at Carnegie Hall\". Don was determined to become a professional musician and singer and, as a 16-year-old, he was already making contacts in the business. After getting his home number from the telephone directory, Don phoned Fred Hellerman and later, Erik Darling. Don and Erik became friends and Don visited his apartment in New York.\n\nThrough Erik Darling, Don recorded his first studio sessions with Lisa Kindred and was invited to join a group with Darling and the other members of the Rooftop Singers. However, even at that time, Don saw himself as a troubadour and turned down the offer.\n\nWhile at Villanova University in 1963 (he stayed for just four months), Don met and became friends with Jim Croce and President Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nAfter leaving Villanova, Don was managed by Harold Leventhal Management. This started a six-year period during which time Don performed at venues like The Bitter End and Gaslight Caf√© in New York, the Newport Folk Festival, The Cellar Door in Washington, D.C., The Main Point in Philadelphia, the Troubadour and Ash Grove in Los Angeles and over forty colleges throughout New York and New England. He appeared alongside artists like Herbie Mann, Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry, Melanie, Steppenwolf, Pete Seeger, Janis Ian, Josh White, Ten Wheel Drive, The James Gang and others.\n\nDon also found time to attend night school at Iona College and, in 1968, graduated with a Bachelors degree in Business Administration but turned down a prestigious scholarship to Columbia University Graduate School.¬†\n\nWhile singing at The Caffe Lena, the New York State Council for the Arts invited Don to become their Hudson River Troubadour. He accepted and spent the summer traveling from town to town in the Hudson Valley, giving talks about the environment and singing songs for whoever would turn up to listen.\n\nA year later, Don was a member of the first crew of the Sloop Clearwater. With Pete Seeger, they travelled the Atlantic seaboard giving concerts at each port and being featured in the news wherever they went.\n\nIn 1969, Don recorded his first album, ‚ÄúTapestry‚Äù, in Berkeley, CA. The student riots were going on outside the studio door as Don was singing ‚ÄúAnd I Love You So‚Äù inside. The album was first released by Mediarts and attracted good reviews and achieved some commercial success. It succeeded in transforming Don McLean from an unknown to an underground sensation. FM radio loved the ‚ÄúTapestry‚Äù album and very quickly, Don became a headliner in nightclubs and colleges across the country.¬†\n\nThe transition to international stardom began in 1971 with the release of \"American Pie‚Äù. \"American Pie‚Äù was recorded on 26th May 1971 and a month later received its first radio airplay on New York's WNEW-FM and WPLJ-FM to mark the closing of The Fillmore East, the historic rock & roll concert venue.\n\nThirty years later, ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù was voted number 5 in a poll of the 365 ‚ÄúSongs of the Century‚Äù compiled by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nThe top five were:\n\"Over the Rainbow\" by Judy Garland\n\"White Christmas\" by Bing Crosby\n\"This Land Is Your Land\" by Woody Guthrie\n\"Respect\" by Aretha Franklin;\nand \"American Pie\" by Don McLean.\n\n‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù was issued as a double A-side single in November 1971 and charted within a month. Because of Don McLean‚Äôs FM-underground career which started with ‚ÄúTapestry,‚Äù the ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù album was played extensively on FM radio. This caused AM radio to play the full eight-minute song at the #1 position. ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù then became the longest song ever to become #1. The single ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù and the album ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù were an international sensation, causing Don McLean to become an international superstar. Every line of the song was analyzed time and time again to find the real meaning. Don refused to sanction any of the many interpretations.\n\nThe second single, \"Vincent‚Äù, charted on 18th March 1972 going on to reach US#12, UK#1. The \"American Pie‚Äù album remained at #1 in the UK for 7 weeks in 1972, and in the UK charts for 53 consecutive weeks.\n\nIn the wake of ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù, Don became a major worldwide concert attraction and was able to call upon material not only from his two albums but from his extensive repertoire of American popular music, 1950s rock & roll and folk music, in addition to the complete catalogues of singers such as Buddy Holly, Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Pete Seeger, and Frank Sinatra, just to name a few.¬†\n\nThe years spent playing gigs in small clubs and coffee houses in the 60s paid off with sell-out concert performances worldwide. Don's first concert at the Albert Hall in 1972 was a triumphant success.\n\nConcert footage and other video clips played to McLean songs formed the award winning 1972 film \"Till Tomorrow‚Äù produced by Bob Elfstrom (a project they had started working on in 1968).\n\nWith all this success, \"Tapestry‚Äù was reissued by United Artists and charted in the USA on 12th February 1972 reaching #111 and the top-15 in the United Kingdom; it includes two of Don's most famous songs: \"And I Love You So‚Äù and \"Castles in the Air‚Äù.\n\nDon's third album, simply entitled \"Don McLean‚Äù, included the song \"The Pride Parade‚Äù that provides an insight into Don's immediate reaction to stardom. Don told \"Melody Maker‚Äù magazine in 1973 that ‚ÄúTapestry‚Äù was an album by someone previously concerned with external situations. ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù combines externals with internals and the resultant success of that album makes the third one (\"Don McLean‚Äù) entirely introspective‚Äù.\n\nThe fourth album, \"Playin‚Äô Favorites‚Äù became a top-40 hit in the UK in 1973 and included the classic, \"Mountains of Mourne‚Äù and Buddy Holly's \"Everyday‚Äù, a live rendition of which returned Don to the UK singles chart. McLean said, ‚ÄúThe last album (\"Don McLean‚Äù) was a study in depression whereas the new one (\"Playin‚Äô Favorites‚Äù) is almost the quintessence of optimism, with a feeling of \"Wow, I just woke up from a bad dream\".\n\n1973 was another great year for Don McLean the songwriter and Don McLean the performer. Perry Como recorded \"And I Love You So‚Äù from the \"Tapestry‚Äù album and took it to the UK top-5 and American top-30. Como's version was nominated for a Grammy but was beaten by \"Killing Me Softly With His Song‚Äù sung by Roberta Flack and written by Norman Gimbel and Charles Fox apparently after Lori Leiberman had attended a McLean concert at the LA Troubadour and heard McLean sing ‚ÄúEmpty Chairs‚Äù. At the time, Gimbel and Fox were writing songs for Lori Leiberman. Leiberman is also a songwriter and the notes that she made after seeing McLean contain many of the phrases included in the lyrics of song. The notebook was taken from her by Norman Gimbel and was never returned. Lori Leiberman has always maintained that McLean was the inspiration for ‚ÄúKilling Me Softly With His Song‚Äù.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Don McLean remained an in-demand concert performer. In 1975, 100,000 fans attended his London Hyde Park concert, second only to The Rolling Stones at that time. 1977, saw a brief liaison with Arista Records that yielded the \"Prime Time‚Äù album. In 1978, Don's career began again in Nashville where he would work with Elvis Presley's backing singers, \"The Jordanaires‚Äù and many of Elvis's musicians. The result was \"Chain Lightning‚Äù and the UK No 1, \"Crying‚Äù. The early 1980s saw further chart successes with \"Since I Don't Have You‚Äù, a new recording of \"Castles in the Air‚Äù and \"It's Just the Sun‚Äù.\n\nIn 1987, the release of the country-based \"Love Tracks\" album gave rise to the hit singles \"Love in My Heart‚Äù (top-10 in Australia), \"Can't Blame the Wreck on the Train‚Äù (US country #49) and \"Eventually‚Äù.\n\nFour years later, Don hit the UK top-10 with \"American Pie‚Äù prompting many appearances on radio and TV including a one-hour special with Nicky Campbell on BBC radio 1, and the recording of the Manchester concert for video release in 1993. A favorite memory for many fans is Don performing \"American Pie‚Äù live on \"Top of the Pops‚Äù in 1991.\n\nIn 1992, many previously unreleased songs became available on \"Favorites and Rarities‚Äù while \"Don McLean Classics‚Äù featured new studio recordings of ‚ÄúAnd I Love You So‚Äù, \"Vincent‚Äù and \"American Pie‚Äù. In 1994, Don appeared at the Buddy Holly tribute in the USA, and \"Guns and Roses‚Äù took a replica of Don's version of \"Since I Don't Have You‚Äù (a US top-20 hit for Don in April 1981) to the UK top-10. In 1995 \"American Pie' returned to the top-40; this time in \"techno-music‚Äù format performed by European artist, Just Luis.\n\nIn 1996, \"Killing Me Softly With His Song‚Äù, performed by The Fugees, was one of the biggest selling singles of the year.\n\nDon McLean credits his 1997 performance of ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù at Garth Brooks‚Äô Central Park concert (attended by over 500,000 people) as the beginning of his third career comeback. According to Don, his first \"comeback\" had been the release of \"Vincent\" and the second, the North American release and massive success of Roy Orbison‚Äôs \"Crying\", which foreshadows the return of Orbison to major stardom.\n\n\"Brooks was joined on stage by two surprise guest stars, Billy Joel and Don McLean, who brought down the house with an acoustic rendition of \"American Pie.\" (CNN, 1997) Video clips from this moment were used exclusively for media coverage around the world.\n\nTwo years later Garth Brooks repaid the favor by appearing as a special guest (with Nanci Griffith) on Don's first ever American TV special, broadcast on PBS and now available as the ‚ÄúStarry Starry Night‚Äù video, DVD and CD.\n\nA month later, Don McLean wound up the 20th century by performing \"American Pie\" for President Clinton. McLean performed the song in front of the Lincoln Memorial, facing the Washington Memorial to 600,000 people. This is the same place McLean visited with his father in 1961. President Clinton personally invited McLean to have dinner at the White House for individuals who had influenced the twentieth century.\n\nIn 2000, Madonna recorded a cover version of \"American Pie\" that on release in the UK entered the official singles chart at number 1 and made the US top-30 on air play points alone. This prompted EMI to release a new \"Best of Don McLean\" CD that gave Don his first top-30 album chart entry in almost 20 years.\n\nMcLean said: \"Madonna is a colossus in the music industry and she is going to be considered an important historical figure as well. She is a fine singer, a fine songwriter and record producer, and she has the power to guarantee success with any song she chooses to record. It is a gift for her to have recorded 'American Pie.' I have heard her version and I think it is sensual and mystical. I also feel that she's chosen autobiographical verses that reflect her career and personal history. I hope it will cause people to ask what's happening to music in America. I have received many gifts from God but this is the first time I have ever received a gift from a goddess.\"¬†\n\n‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù was named one of the Top 5 Songs of the 20th Century by the RIAA, and in 2002 was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nEven more surprising than Madonna having a hit with a Don McLean song, was George Michael's decision in 2003 to record \"The Grave\", from the American Pie album, as a protest against the Iraq war. He recorded the song for MTV and performed it live on Top of the Pops.\n\nDon said: \"I am proud of George Michael for standing up for life and sanity. I am delighted that he chose a song of mine to express these feelings. We must remember that the Wizard is really a cowardly old man hiding behind a curtain with a loud microphone. It takes courage and a song to pull the curtain open and expose him. Good Luck George.\"\n¬†\n\nThe 21st Century has seen a number of new honors for Don McLean and his music. Iona College conferred an honorary doctorate on Don in 2001 and, in February 2002, \"American Pie\" was finally inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.¬†\n¬†\n\nIn 2004 Don McLean was inaugurated into the National Academy of Popular Music Songwriters' Hall of Fame and in 2007 he shared his life story in Alan Howard's biography, tiled ‚ÄúKilling Us Softly With His Songs‚Äù.\n\nIn 2009 his studio album, ‚ÄúAddicted to Black‚Äù, was released and in 2010 he returned to Europe for a seven nation tour, including the Royal Albert Hall, London on May 7th.\n\n2011 has seen another tour of UK and Ireland, including a sensational appearance at Europe's largest music festival, Glastonbury.\n\nIn February 2012 McLean won the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Life Time Achievement award.[49]\n\nIn March 2012, the PBS network broadcast a feature-length documentary about the life and music of McLean called Don McLean: American Troubadour produced by four-time Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Jim Brown.\n\nIn 2015, one of McLean‚Äôs four handwritten manuscripts of the lyrics to ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù was auctioned by Christies, selling for just over $1.2 Million.\n¬†\n\n2017 brought a huge honor when ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù was inducted into the Library of Congress‚Äô National Recording Registry, joining less than 500 works including ‚ÄúSomewhere Over the Rainbow,‚Äù other classical music compositions, infamous live broadcasts, and similar recordings.\n\nIn 2018, McLean released his 19th studio album, Botanical Gardens, to critical acclaim. Arguably one of his most reflective recordings to date. As he characterized it, ‚ÄúThe inspiration for the project started years ago when I would walk in the beautiful gardens in Sydney, Australia near the Opera House. I would dream young dreams and it was a comfort and an inspiration. I was always young inside, like we all are, and I felt it again there.‚Äù\n\nDon McLean continues to receive honors for his musical discography. Throughout his career artists including Garth Brooks, Madonna, Drake, Josh Groban, Weird Al Yankovic, and others have recorded songs written by the Songwriter Hall of Fame member. In October 2019, McLean was bestowed with plaques certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for gold, platinum, and multi-platinum sales in the United States, as well as presentations from Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom were bestowed on McLean.\n\n2019 honored Don with a star on the Las Vegas Walkway of Stars and his song ‚ÄúAnd I Love You So‚Äù was the theme for Prince Harry and Megan Markle‚Äôs wedding.\n\n‚ÄúAs a songwriter your songs are like your children, and you are hopeful everyone loves them as much as you do, but rarely is that the case. I am so grateful that songs I have written have touched so many lives and have been recorded by so many great artists,‚Äù said McLean. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs presentation has truly blown me away as I never realized the success that my songs have brought to these amazing people.‚Äù\n¬†\n\nDon landed a new recording contract with Time Life in 2020, with whom he released 11 albums containing 173 tracks as well as a new album ‚ÄúStill Playin' Favorites‚Äù. 2021 saw Don‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù featured in the Avengers‚Äô Black Widow and the new Tom Hanks movie Finch. Don received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, celebrated the 50th anniversary of ‚ÄúAmerican Pie,‚Äù recorded a version of the song with a cappella group Home Free, resulting in the video which was #1 for 8 weeks on the country music video charts, a children‚Äôs book has been written, and much more!\n\nMcLean continues to license his music and lyrics to commercials, movies, and fellow artists. McLean‚Äôs body of work is published through Benny Bird Company, Inc and administered through Universal Music Publishing. Don McLean owns five trademarks. They are: Don McLean, American Pie, The Day The Music Died, Bye-Bye, Miss American Pie, and Starry Starry Night.",

        "description": "Minneapolis songwriter Mason Jennings shares his new video for the single, ‚ÄúOnly Lovers Welcome‚Äù from his brand new album, Underneath The Roses out now via Loosegroove Records. Underneath The Roses is available on limited-edition colored vinyl and is available here.  Watch and share the video for ‚ÄúOnly Lovers Welcome‚Äù here.  \nJennings writes that the songs from Underneath The Roses were, ‚ÄúWritten in an unprecedented burst,‚Äù following the birth of his son, Western, in March 2022. Jennings explains, ‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt written any songs in about a year. I had been dealing with the psychological after effects of the pandemic as well as the loss of my dad. So, when Western was born I didn‚Äôt expect to be writing much. But immediately he was responding to music in a very intense way. For this album, between May and November 2022, I wrote 48 songs! They certainly uplifted me and connected me with the creative spirit, and spirit in general, again. They cover all kinds of ground but, when I listen back, I think the central theme is overcoming fear with love.‚Äù\nJennings also released a video for, ‚ÄúNo Ordinary Friend,‚Äù which he explains, ‚ÄúDepicts two of the most important decisions a person can make. One, whether or not they believe in a loving higher power and two, who they decide to choose as a life long romantic partner. This song is referring to both of those and the choices I‚Äôve made.‚Äù\n\"Stone Gossard and Regan Hagar from Loosegroove Records helped me edit the 48 down to 11. I then enlisted the help of my Painted Shield bandmates to record the songs.‚Äù \nJennings and Gossard are ongoing collaborators in the band Painted Shield, who released their 2021 debut album on Loosegroove, the influential indie label that Gossard founded back in 1994 issued records from acts such as Critters Buggin, Malfunkshun, Weapon of Choice and Devilhead, and was the launching point for Queens of the Stone Age‚Äôs debut album in 1998. \nJenning‚Äôs previous album ‚ÄòReal Heart‚Äô came out in January 2022 and received Triple/Non-comm radio across KCMP Minneapolis, WFPK Louisville, WPYA Birmingham, KRCL Salt Lake City, WMMM Madison, WQKL Ann Arbor, KCSN LA, KRVB Boise, WCLZ Portland, WDSE Duluth, WRLT Nashville, WXPN Philly, WXRV Boston, & WZEW Mobile.  \nPress highlights include: American Songwriter, Relix, No Depression, Grateful Web, Take Effect 9/10 review, & Jam Bands  \nJennings adds ‚ÄúI called it Underneath The Roses because I feel like these songs are musical roses and when I look below them there are many thorns and so much dirt and soil. All of it was needed for them to come into existence and bloom. It‚Äôs been a long hard road of self-discovery and discernment for me the last few years and the roses wouldn‚Äôt be here without what lies underneath. Hope you enjoy the music!‚Äù",

        "description": "Throughout his prolific career, Femi Kuti has stood as a powerful voice for justice, carrying forward the revolutionary Afrobeat legacy pioneered by his father, Fela Kuti. Known for his unflinching critiques of political corruption and social inequality, Femi‚Äôs heady mix of funk, jazz and highlife has always been a tool for resistance and change.\nBut on Journey Through Life, his new album out in 2025 via Partisan Records, Femi turns inwards, balancing the political themes that have defined his career with deeply personal reflections on family, life, and inner growth: ‚ÄúI wanted to talk more about me, about my thoughts and the goals and values that have guided me all these years and led me to where I am now. ¬†I‚Äôve never done that on an album before‚Äù says Femi.¬†\nFemi began his career as a member of Fela's legendary band, Egypt ‚Äô80, and briefly stepped into the role of frontman when his father was imprisoned on fabricated charges in 1984. In 1986 he left to create his own band Positive Force, and has been forging his own style of Afrobeat ever since, adding doses of R&B, rock, and hip hop to the traditional Yoruba rhythms and jazzy horns. Lyrically, however, his focus has remained firmly on issues of power, oppression, and social injustice, and his activism has extended beyond music through collaborations with organizations like Global Citizen and his role as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been so political, and I will continue to be, but when I look back, my life has not only been about this. Yes, I get very depressed about my immediate environment and when I travel and I see sadness, but I also see how my music brings joy to people who come to my concert. I am a very homely person, I love my children very much, and I thought it was important for people to see that‚Äù says Femi.¬†\nThe title track encapsulates Femi‚Äôs introspective journey, with his soaring sax solo mirroring the song's uplifting message. Against a backdrop of sturdy, syncopated rhythms, he encourages listeners to ‚Äúenjoy and learn from experience/Make the best of your journey through life,‚Äù all while reflecting on its ephemeral nature.¬†\nDespite his more contemplative focus, Femi hasn‚Äôt turned his back to the wider world, and the politically charged energy that has long been a hallmark of his music is still strong across the album. On ‚ÄúPolitics Don Expose Them‚Äù he refers back to one of his most famous tracks, 1998‚Äôs ‚ÄúSorry Sorry‚Äù, which ¬†‚Äî in turn echoing the fierce message of Fela's ‚ÄúZombie‚Äù ¬†‚Äî claimed there was no difference between ¬†the outgoing military regime and the politicians who were about to take power. ‚ÄúSo this is just to say, I told you so. Politics has exposed the true character of our politicians, they are just as corrupt and have put us in a very bad predicament‚Äù says Femi. In true Kuti style, the biting lyrics are woven into melodious sax lines, ¬†impossibly catchy horn riffs, and squelchy synths ‚Äî ¬† truly embodying the spirit of Femi‚Äôs signature ‚Äúsweet music with a bitter message.‚Äù¬†\n‚ÄúAfter 24 Years‚Äù, which has been recorded for the first time with new lyrics after decades of being a fan favorite in Lagos‚Äô New Africa Shrine, echoes similar sentiments, with the chorus powerfully declaring: ‚Äúafter 24 years/with confidence we fit say/These politicians failed the nation‚Äù over triumphant horn riffs and a buoyant key motif.¬†\nThe New African Shrine, which Femi runs with his sister Yeni, ¬†was established in 2000 to honor Fela‚Äôs legacy, and it continues to serve as a place of resistance and proud cultural expression. Femi‚Äôs Sunday night performances with his band The Positive Force have become iconic, and every year the Felabration festival celebrates Afrobeat‚Äôs impact on post-colonial Africa.¬†\nAs Femi reflects on his journey so far, he revisits several other old tracks, including three ‚Äî ¬†‚ÄúLast Mugu,‚Äù ‚ÄúOga Doctor,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThink My People Think‚Äù ‚Äî ¬†dating back to the early '90s, not only in an effort to preserve his legacy but to reshape it in a way that mirrors the person he has become, both spiritually and musically. ‚ÄúCorruption Na Stealing‚Äù for example, ¬†initially recorded in 2018 for One People One World, re-emerges with a bolder, funkier sound that amplifies its message:‚ÄúI never liked the mood really, I didn‚Äôt like the feeling it left me with. But when we played it live at The Shrine, it was one of the best, so I wanted to capture that feeling for this album‚Äù he explains. ¬†Similarly, ‚ÄúShotan‚Äù, ¬†originally recorded live in 2004, takes on new life in this album with a fresh studio version infused with a raw, punk energy.¬†\nWhile he has always composed all of his own music, this marks the first time he has also been in charge of every aspect of production: ‚ÄúIt was very important for me to do it this time, and probably for my future work. ¬†I am at a stage where I want to emphasize my creativity, expressing how I truly feel from deep within. I want to delve deeper‚Äîspiritually, socially, and politically as well.‚Äù¬†\nThis is particularly clear on ¬†‚ÄúWork on Myself‚Äù, where Femi candidly reflects on his feelings of helplessness in the face of global turmoil and his commitment to personal growth as a way to navigate it. ‚ÄúThere is so much chaos around me, and sometimes I feel like I have no power to change anything. I feel so helpless, and I know a lot of people around the world feel the same. My way is to keep working on myself, to always become a better person and better musician‚Äù says Femi, adding that the moments of self reflection while working on this particular track have helped shape his ‚Äúmind and soul‚Äù: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget, I am just a medium, I don‚Äôt know where the inspiration comes from, the more humble I am the more this ideas will come and and guide my life and prepare me for the future.‚Äù\nThis album is deeply personal for Femi in another way, as it was written while his daughter was going through some serious health issues: ‚ÄúIt just made me reflect on a lot of things, and on my journey as a father.‚Äù It also follows Legacy+, the double album he worked on with his son Made: ¬†‚ÄúMaking music with my son reshaped the way I approach everything,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEach album feeds into the next, and without that experience, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today.‚Äù¬†\nJourney Through Life represents both a continuation and a departure for Femi Kuti. While he remains committed to using his music as a vehicle for political and social change, this album marks a new chapter, one where his inner reflections take center stage. ‚ÄúI think I will keep going in this direction,‚Äù he says of his future work. ‚ÄúThis album has helped me learn more about myself, and I hope it can inspire others to do the same.‚Äù¬†\nAt 62, Femi stands at a creative crossroads, poised to explore new depths while staying true to the roots that have shaped him. Journey Through Life offers a profound and personal reflection on the values, struggles, and triumphs that have defined Femi‚Äôs life, both on stage and off.",

        "description": "Ambrosia, the band known and loved by a multitude of fans since the 1970‚Äôs, is now more alive and compelling than ever. This 5-time Grammy Nominated ensemble is exploring new musical territory and bringing an exceptional musical performance to stages everywhere.¬†\n\nIn 1970, four young musicians from the South Bay of Los Angeles, came together to create a new moving and invigorating style of music. Joseph Puerta, Christopher North, David Pack, and Burleigh Drummond produced a sound that was immediately recognized. Today, Ambrosia is three of the original members with the addition of guitarist Doug Jackson, contributing keyboardist Mary Harris, and powerful lead vocals of Kipp Lennon (from the band Venice).¬†\n\nAlways exploring the possibilities of progressive, classical, and world influences ‚Äì with tangled roots of soul, rhythm, and blues ‚Äì Ambrosia is continuing to entertain their original fans while still engaging newer audiences.¬†\n\nOriginally labeled as America‚Äôs answer to the progressive invasion of English acts Yes and King Crimson, the group quickly proved itself with a unique blend of aural landscapes. Their musical styles attracted the collaboration with cultural icons Leonard Bernstein, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Alan Parsons, Bruce Hornsby, Michael McDonald, Edgar Winter, Dave Mason, Gary Wright, Al Stewart, and others. Ambrosia had toured extensively with Fleetwood Mac, Heart, and the Doobie Brothers.¬†\n\nDuring Ambrosia‚Äôs early recording history they garnered 5 Grammy Nominations, received frequent radio airplay, and gained the admiration and respect of the musical community ‚Äì in addition to their sold out concerts around the world. Ambrosia achieved 5 Top 40 hit singles on Warner Bros. Records, released between 1975 and 1980, including ‚ÄúHow Much I Feel‚Äù and ‚ÄúBiggest Part of Me‚Äù. In 2015 the group released a new single, ‚ÄúHopes and Dreams‚Äù, which was featured on the series called The Sparrows that aired on the Fox television channel. As of 2017, the new Ambrosia material keeps coming.¬†\n\nBringing a breathtaking performance of their classic hits as well as new moving music, Ambrosia puts on a perfect show for any stage, casino, night club, festival, or special event.¬†\n\n¬†‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you do it!‚Äù¬†\n\n‚ÄìJimmy Fallon (accolades from Jimmy himself after performance on the Jimmy Fallon Show)¬†\n\n‚ÄúWith a solid set list and captivating performance, it‚Äôs evident that Ambrosia still has a lot in the proverbial rock tank.‚Äù ‚ÄìSteven Neff (Music Enthusiast Magazine)¬†\n\n‚ÄúAmbrosia is one of my favorite bands. These guys are just wonderful to see live and hear their beautiful music. True and absolutely professional musicians. That‚Äôs why I keep going to see them every year.‚Äù¬†\n\n‚ÄìBluesman (Review posted on Goldstar)",

        "description": "They say it ain‚Äôt where you‚Äôre from, it‚Äôs where you‚Äôre at. But for Angus Dowling, Jack ‚ÄòCool-Breeze‚Äô Crowther and Dr Elliot ‚ÄòLove Wisdom‚Äô O‚ÄôReilly, the character of their home, Australia‚Äôs idyllic Gold Coast, permeates every atom of the dreamlike, joyful, psychedelic music they create together as Babe Rainbow. ‚ÄúThe old Aquarius hippie connection is everywhere around here,‚Äù singer Angus says. ‚ÄúWe tap into it, and absorb it all.‚Äù And their new album, Slipper Imp And Shakaerator, is their most ‚Äúhomegrown‚Äù project yet ‚Äì a suite of maverick, zephyr-light acid-pop following its own north star and chasing subtle, slippery, subterranean grooves to delirious destinations.¬†\nThe trio grew up in Rainbow Bay, later relocating to nearby Byron Bay. An area of breathtaking natural beauty, where the waves are always strong, the magic mushrooms grow freely, and old, abandoned farm buildings abound. It was and remains the perfect locale for young dudes to play their music as loud as they want. ‚ÄúWe were 16 and 17 years old, working at Tropical Fruit World in Duranbah, cruising around the kiosks and listening to the Nuggets compilations,‚Äù remembers Angus, of the group‚Äôs earliest days. ‚ÄúJack and I met in the Australian youth choir as junior songbirds years before that, and he was still the only technical musical guy I knew, but I had the feeling we could all play this music we loved in our own way. We lived on an avocado farm up around then, in the macadamia orchard of the property. And it was so much fun making random noise while surrounded by the mangoes and the bush.‚Äù\nThe trio jammed tirelessly in those abandoned shacks, and as their sound began to develop, they booked shows in Brisbane, the nearest city, a two-hour drive away. While playing Brisbane, they crossed paths with King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, who began to book the embryonic Babe Rainbow as opening band at their shows. ‚ÄúThis is before Gizz‚Äôs ‚Äòstadium-rock‚Äô period,‚Äù Dowling grins.\nThe Gizz connection would prove fortuitous for Babe Rainbow, who signed to the group‚Äôs Flightless label for their 2015 eponymous EP, and whose 2017 self-titled debut LP was produced by Gizzard King Stu Mackenzie. The album established a loyal following for Babe Rainbow, one which has only grown over the records since. And Babe Rainbow‚Äôs music itself has evolved across those years, as the band have travelled, toured the world and connected with new friends in faraway places. ‚ÄúEarly on, we got to play in California, came early, stayed late, caught a ton of good waves and met some of the best people in the world,‚Äù Angus says. ‚ÄúWe began rolling around the world, picking up new styles and collaborating with everybody.‚Äù¬†\nThis creative sprawl reached its apotheosis with 2022‚Äôs The Organic Band, which Angus remembers as coming together ‚Äúon the road, a lot of friends together. We met [drummer] Miles Myjavec from Sydney and began chucking ideas down. We were meeting amazing people in California and London and Paris just jamming and singing, everyone‚Äôs so happy, having the best time ever.‚Äù¬†\nFor the new album, however, Babe Rainbow have opted for a different approach ‚Äì one Angus says ‚Äúkeeps to the powers of the Rainbow‚Äù. The collaborations with all the free spirits they encounter along the way have been curtailed this time. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd done a few albums of us experimenting with people we met on the road and bringing in influence from everywhere,‚Äù says Angus. ‚ÄúThis is the first record since our debut EP where it‚Äôs just the ‚Äòoriginal Gs‚Äô, pushing the songwriting in the direction we want, without any groove geniuses around helping us in those really deep and special moments of writing a song.‚Äù This back-to-basics, back-to-the-source vibe explains the album‚Äôs enigmatic title, the (Bunyip) Slipper Imp and the Shakaerator, aka the Yeoman plow, a sub-soiler chisel plow designed for the more extreme conditions found in Australia, the ‚Äúrevolutionary new ripper of great strength ‚Äì haha!‚Äù says Angus.\nThe trio took over a massive warehouse on an old banana farm where they could get to work alongside friend and producer Timon Martin and magical Miles Myjavec on percussion and flute. The roots of the tracks often lay in riffs and figures cooked up by guitarist Jack Crowther. ‚Äú‚ÄòCool Breeze‚Äô has always got something going on‚Äù says Angus. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always keen to jam, and Timon‚Äôs so good with helping to realise the potential of a song.‚Äù The key this time was not to overwork these early ideas, to give them space ‚Äúto flow, to grow‚Äù, he explains. ‚ÄúKeeping a loose feeling to the music is so important. An idea develops together outside but it doesn't take its wings until you take it into the studio. Every step of the way, I'm always trying to stay connected to Jack‚Äôs original moment of inspiration. We experiment with synths and drum machines and overdubs, and we love that, but we never wanna escape too far from the hippie power of the music. We're made of rainbow.‚Äù\nThat looseness and that true essence are key to the pleasures within Slipper Imp And Shakaerator. The album rambles gleefully wild, the jams running long but with purpose, lysergic harmonies loosely tethered to deftly funky rhythms loops and fragments of guitar that channel the lyricism of high-life (What Is Ashwagandha), the flash of 80s funk (Like Cleopatra, a glorious, sun-soaked pop banger in disguise), the white-heat of acid-rock (When The Milk Flows). There are haunting instrumental vignettes (Apollonia), nuggets of lo-fi introspection (Now And Zen), even a massive, ground-quaking, reggae-informed excursion starring old friend Stu Mackenzie (the woozy, wonderful Mt Dub), who also mixed the album.\nIndeed, while the connection between the core Rainbow Babes here is crucial to the character of Slipper Imp And Shakearator, they weren‚Äôt working entirely alone. One key collaborator was singer Camille Jansen, who the group met through their friend and old band mate Maria Benz, and who joined them onstage on their recent US tour. ‚ÄúCami sang on all the songs on the album, but I feel we haven‚Äôt fully tapped into our connection together yet,‚Äù says Angus. ‚ÄúShe brings an insane new flavour, which is stupendous. It feels really cool and powerful to add her to this lineup.‚Äù\nBut ultimately, Slipper Imp And Shakearator is a celebration of all the colours of the Babe Rainbow ‚Äì the milk, Angus jokes. ‚ÄúI love the fact that, with all the touring and the changing tides, and hair, the creative relationship within the band still feels so strong. I feel so lucky to have this psychedelic family, which is really the essence of the band. We‚Äôre just a bunch of laid back surfers, cattlemen‚Äôs sons.‚Äù\nBut as Slipper Imp And Shakearator proves, these babes have access to powerful, home-baked psychedelic magic, and they aren‚Äôt reluctant to share. Come grab some ‚Äì all are welcome.",

        "description": "WITCH - Sogolo (2025)¬†\nZamrock, the Afro-rock genre that swept southern Africa in the 1970s, was born in the Copperbelt region of northern Zambia, and WITCH was at the center of it all. In the beginning, lead singer Emmanuel ‚ÄòJagari‚Äô Chanda and the band looked for a name to match edgy rock sounds coming from Europe and America. First they tried Kingston Market, which sounded too reggae-ish, then they tried Footswitch, but there was a local artist called Dr Footswitch, so they shortened it to Switch, and then finally WITCH. ‚ÄúThe posters were handwritten,‚Äù Jagari recalled, ‚Äúso we would draw somebody on a broomstick.‚Äù Hot out of the gate, WITCH signed to Teal Records and began touring in a truck with a canopy emblazoned with the words: ‚ÄúTrespassers will be eaten‚Äù The graphic artist who wrote those words also gave the band its enduring acronym: We Intend To Cause Havoc. Jagari recalls, ‚ÄúThere was no hesitation. Everyone agreed‚Äù And the rest is history.¬†\nFast forward four decades, and Jagari, along with veteran keyboardist/composer Patrick Mwondela, now lead a new, multi-national formation of the band. Sogolo is their second 21st century release. It‚Äôs the follow up to Zango (2021), which was recorded against all odds in the same Lusaka studio that WITCH frequented in the ‚Äò70s‚Äîfunky and dilapidated, but with a vibe that heralded a reawakening for the band.¬†\nAll this came as a surprise to Jagari, who had been trying his hand at gemstone mining when filmmaker Gio Arlotta arrived in 2014 - during Zambia‚Äôs jubilee independence celebration - to begin work on his 2019 documentary WITCH (We Intend to Cause Havoc). The gemstone quest was a bust, but Jagari recalls, ‚ÄúSometimes when one door closes, another will open, and that turns out to be WITCH resurrected. Amazing! It has given me a new lease of life.‚Äù¬†\nSogolo was tracked in Berlin, during a 10-day break in the band‚Äôs 2024 tour schedule. The lineup included Cuban-Dominican percussionist Charlie Garmendia, guitarist Stefan Lilov, Jacco Gardner on bass, Nicola Mauskovic on drums, and two singers from Zambia, Hannah Tembo and Theresa Ng'ambi. ‚ÄúSometimes we just jammed,‚Äù says Jagari. ‚ÄúBut we tolerated one another and trusted their contributions. Fortunately, what has come out seems to be good. Each one feels they have contributed something.‚Äù ¬†\nSogolo means ‚Äúfuture, or front‚Äù echoing a longstanding ethic of the band, going back to their 1980 disco album, Moving On. Jacco Gardner produced Sogolo. ‚ÄúThe studio for Zango wasn't in use for bands for decades, so we had to really make it work,‚Äù he recalls. A more ‚Äúpractical‚Äù option turned out to be Big Snuff Studio in Berlin. ‚ÄúWe would all be together, and in shape because we're on tour, playing every night. So we had a good dynamic going as a band.‚Äù The studio was well-tooled but small, and time was tight. Jacco felt the pressure. ‚ÄúThis was a big deal,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe were contributing to the legacy of a legendary band with a dense discography and history.‚Äù¬†\nJagari‚Äôs song ‚ÄúKamusale‚Äù punches with crunchy guitar, crying vocals and a ‚ÄúHelter Skelter‚Äù vibe, but it‚Äôs based on a Bemba children‚Äôs game song. ‚ÄúChildren gather under the moonlight in the village and pretend to be preparing themselves for marriage,‚Äù says Jagari. ‚ÄúSo we are saying as kids, be careful who you pick. Don't follow the beauty of the face or body. Go deeper into the\ncharacter and make sure you are marrying the right person.‚Äù Funky and urgent, Jagari‚Äôs ‚ÄúQueenless King,‚Äù also deals with the perils of marriage, specifically what happens when family pressure forces a bad decision. ‚ÄúYou are enticed to marry someone because of her beauty, not knowing that her true colors are very cunning. In the end you discover her wicked ways. You end up being a queenless king.‚Äù¬†\nThe elders of WITCH strive to nurture younger musicians. ‚ÄúAt this stage in our life,‚Äù says Patrick, ‚ÄúWe would love to empower young musicians to use our platform. For us, it's not about chasing fame and fortune; it's making sure the legacy continues.‚Äù That‚Äôs how singers Theresa Ng'ambi and Hanna Tembo got recruited into the band during the Zango session.¬†\n‚ÄúMachiriso,‚Äù a loping, groovy Afro-rap number, grew out of a duo bass jam between Jacco and Jagari during a lunch break. ‚ÄúWe were doing two basses,‚Äù recalls Jagari, ‚Äúand then Theresa came in to sing randomly. She's saying, ‚ÄòWe have gathered together as WITCH to give you the message of love and peace.‚Äô‚Äù The rolling ternary rhythms of ‚ÄúNibani‚Äù come from a sound check jam among the musicians. ‚ÄúWe didn't even know it was being recorded,‚Äù says Jacco. ‚ÄúNadi‚Äù is the hardest rocking track on the album. ‚ÄúWith that song,‚Äù says Jacco, ‚Äúwe tried to reference the heavy Zamrock sound.‚Äù That‚Äôs the garage band style that WITCH began with before verging into more complex progressive rock, then traditional rhythms, Afrobeat vibes, and in the early ‚Äò80s, disco. As Jacco put it, ‚ÄúWe had a lot to reference.‚Äù¬†\n‚ÄúTiponde Madzi,‚Äù another track born from a hotel room jam, veers mback and forth between a ritualistic slow march and a rollicking 6/8 groove. Jagari explains that the words tell an old story in which animals gather looking for water by stomping on the earth. They compete for success, but in the end, it‚Äôs the humble tortoise who finds the water. ‚ÄúThe tortoise is the one they belittled. ‚ÄòWhat can you do? You have no strength.‚Äô So there‚Äôs a moral lesson: don't underestimate anyone.‚Äù¬†\nPatrick says the essence of WITCH‚Äôs sound is emotion. ‚ÄúThis is how music touches people. It could be love, it could be war, it could be anything, but music is emotional.‚Äù Patrick‚Äôs reggae/gospel song ‚ÄúTotally Devoted‚Äù takes words from the Bible‚Äôs Psalm 23. ‚ÄúWe can go through problems, we can go through the valley of the shadow of death, but I fear no evil because God is with me.‚Äù Jagari notes that this song was inspired by Patrick‚Äôs traumatic experience. ‚ÄúWhile we were on tour in Chicago, Patrick fell ill,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúHe had bloodclots in his lungs, so it was a threat to his life, and he didn't finish the tour. So he is saying thank you to the Lord Jesus Christ.‚Äù¬†\nAfter the hurried sessions in Berlin, Jacco had work to do rounding out and finishing the songs. He and Charlie added percussion overdubs and cosmic ambient sonics. ‚ÄúThe studio had a lot of analog electronic instruments,‚Äù says Jacco, ‚Äúand I have a weak spot for German electronic music from the ‚Äò70s, flavors that had Zambian vibes. This is a more futuristic album than Zango, and they trusted me in the creative process. I felt honored to be allowed to experiment.‚Äù¬†\nTrue to that futuristic spirit, Jagari and Patrick are looking ahead, not back. ‚ÄúThe Rolling Stones?‚Äù says Jagari. ‚ÄúHow long have they been together? A long, long time. They have money, but they're still doing something they love. I think it's the same thing with us. My hope is that the\nlonger we stay together, whether with the young ones, the old ones, whoever can fit into the genre, they're welcome.‚Äù Patrick concurs, ‚ÄúThere's more to come, and more songs to share with the world.‚Äù",

        "description": "Derrick ‚ÄúDuckie‚Äù Simpson the ‚ÄúGong Gong Gullie‚Äù is the founder and leader for reggae‚Äôs BLACK UHURU. Although going through numerous lead singers and musicians they have remained to be one of the most recognized and prolific reggae band for over 45 years. The Group‚Äôs line up is Duckie Simpson, Andrew Bees, and Elsa Green.\n¬†\nThe roots of BLACK UHURU were formed in Kingston Jamaica‚Äôs Waterhouse district also known as ‚ÄúFirehouse‚Äù in the early 60‚Ä≤s. Though considered to be one of Jamaica‚Äôs toughest neighbourhoods it‚Äôs home to several other reggae singers and musicians. It was where Duckie Simpson grew up and learned to sing from boyhood friends Winston ‚ÄúPipe‚Äù Matthews and Lloyd ‚ÄúBread‚Äù McDonald of Wailing Souls and Bob Marley. He recorded four tracks with Wailing Souls before forming his own group.\n¬†\nThe original Uhuru‚Äôs (Swahili for freedom) were Derrick ‚ÄúDuckie‚Äù Simpson, Ervin ‚ÄúDon Carlos‚Äù Spencer and Rudolph ‚ÄúGarth‚Äù Dennis. They only recorded a few singles ‚ÄúFolk Songs‚Äù ‚ÄúTime Is On Our Side‚Äù and ‚ÄúSlow Coach‚Äù before separating. Don went solo and Garth joined Wailing Souls.\n¬†\nDuckie reformed the group adding Michael Rose & Errol ‚ÄúTarzan‚Äù Nelson, both from Waterhouse. They recorded their debut album ‚ÄúLove Crises‚Äù in 1977 at Prince Jammy‚Äôs famous studio in Waterhouse on St. Lucia Road. It was later re-released as ‚ÄúBlack Sounds Of Freedom‚Äù. Errol later left to join The Jayes. He was soon replaced by American female singer & dancer Sandra ‚ÄúPuma‚Äù Jones. They teamed up with drummer Sly Dunbar and bass player Robbie Shakespeare. Together they developed a musical style full of deep bass thumps, loud drum slaps, sharp keyboards, long instrumentals with guitar riffs, whirly back round noises, echos and the signature‚Äùwoh oh oh‚Äôs‚Äù creating they‚Äôre ‚Äúclassic‚Äù sound. Producing hits like ‚ÄúI Love King Sellassie, ‚Äú‚ÄòShine Eye Gals‚Äù, ‚ÄúGeneral Penitentiary‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is Life‚Äù.\n¬†\nBLACK UHURU released the albums Red, Chill Out, Sinsemila and Guess Who‚Äôs Coming To Dinner and began to tour the world bringing them to international audiences. It was during this period they started to gain rapid popularity. They opened live shows for the Rolling Stones and the Police. They began to work with other well accomplished producers and musicians. Keith Richards played guitar for the ‚ÄúShine Eye Gal‚Äù track. Dennis Brown ‚ÄúThe Crown Prince of Reggae‚Äù produced the tracks ‚ÄúRent Man‚Äù and Wood For My Fire‚Äù. The track‚Äù Spongi Reggae‚Äù appeared on an episode of The Bill Cosby Show and ‚ÄúParty in Session‚Äù in the movie 1980‚Ä≤s North Shore. BLACK UHURU made reggae history when they won the first ever Grammy Award for reggae music in 1984 for the album Anthem Shortly after the grammy Michael Rose went solo.\n¬†\nAnother Waterhouse resident named Delroy ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù Reid became the new lead singer. They released two albums Brutal and Positive. The Brutal album was nominated for a grammy. They filmed three music videos for the tracks ‚ÄúFire City‚Äù ‚ÄúBrutal‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGreat Train Robbery‚Äù, that track also played on a popular video game Grand Theft Auto. Sadly in 1990, due to ill health, Sandra ‚ÄúPuma‚Äù Jones passed away of cancer. Junior Reid shortly went solo.\n¬†\nThen the original three re-united. They released four albums Now, Iron Storm, Mystical Truth and Strong. Each album was nominated for grammy.

        "description": "Hailed as one of the most exciting live acts on the road today, Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers are musical beacons of the Southwest fueled by witty and insightful lyrics, crunching guitar riffs, a dynamic rhythm section and tequila. RCPM are the only act to release seven consecutive studio albums to land on the top 10 of Billboard‚Äôs Internet Sales Chart, two at No. 1, all released on a 100% independent record label.\n\nDubbed the ‚ÄúSpringsteen of the Southwest‚Äù by the Asbury Park Press, Roger Clyne and his guitar have toured around the world over his 20-year career, starting with The Refreshments. The seminal Tempe, Arizona band made big waves in the ‚Äô90s both on college and alternative rock radio as well as MTV with the songs ‚ÄúBanditos‚Äù (with the infamous chorus, ‚ÄúEverybody knows that the world is full of stupid people‚Äù) and ‚ÄúDown Together‚Äù as well as writing the theme for TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúKing of the Hill.‚Äù\n\nMore than¬†20 years later, Clyne and Refreshments drummer PH Naffah, along with bassist Nick Scropos and lead guitarist Jim Dalton keep the songs of The Refreshments alive, while adding to their own ever growing musical legacy. RCPM‚Äôs latest album is, Native Heart, and marks the 10th studio album released by Roger Clyne & PH Naffah.\n\nA testament to their growing and extremely loyal fan base is the band‚Äôs annual music festival in Rocky Point, Mexico, called Circus Mexicus. What began as a rooftop show thrown together with extension cords and wooden pallets more than 15 years ago has blossomed into a pilgrimage that draws thousands of fans to the once sleepy fishing village. In 2014, fans from 43 states and 7 countries represented at Circus Mexicus.\n\nClyne not only sings about life in the border-lands, he also produces his own private label top shelf tequila called Mexican Moonshine. From Gold medals in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition to Gold Ribbons from Tequila Aficionado‚Äôs Brands of Promise, accolades have been rolling in. And a bottle of Mexican Moonshine Tequila made a well received ‚Äúguest appearance‚Äù on the Rachel Ray Show.\n\nIn 2016, Clyne‚Äôs career came full circle as Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers celebrated the 20th anniversary of The Refreshments cult classic debut album, ‚ÄúFizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy,‚Äù with a residency at the Yucca Tap Room in their hometown of Tempe, followed by a nationwide tour.",
